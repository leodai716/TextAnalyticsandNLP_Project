JAN1	Calling fellow 18-year-olds: Here’s how we help give Britain a Final Say on Brexit	I believe three things about British politics. One, the public hates Westminster. Two, Brexit will leave my generation with what is arguably the worst inheritance in peacetime history. Three, the political class don’t understand points one or two.  For years, it was assumed that young people would not vote, would not take part in politics, and fundamentally did not care. During this time, we’ve been priced out of housing (particularly in London), had our tuition fees trebled and been given the cold shoulder by MPs. 
JAN1	The annual ‘banned’ words lists are a frustrating reminder of how much society dismisses youth culture	Ah, Christmas. Full of presents, overeating and hours spent trying to explain what it is you’re on about to everyone else in the room. “Ghosting, grandma?” you say, with a slower and louder voice than usual. “It’s when someone you thought liked you just disappears. But your boss can also ghost you. And... you can ghost other people.”
JAN1	Singapore is trying to tackle its pollution problem with a ‘smoking ban’ – but it won’t work	As of today, Singapore will introduce a “no smoking zone” along a 3km stretch of Orchard Road – one of the city’s busiest shopping districts. It sounds controversial – restricting people’s right to smoke in public spaces, as a way of tackling air pollution and improving public health. But smoking is not actually banned down the length of Orchard Road: instead, smokers will be concentrated in 40 designated smoking areas, spaced 100-200 metres apart.  Air pollution is a major challenge for cities around the world, as it’s a significant cause of death and ill-health. City dwellers have a hard time avoiding the impacts of poor air quality, and children, the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions are most vulnerable.
JAN1	It's no surprise that the far right has worked out how to appeal to the middle-class, digitally savvy youth	Every era, and every region, has its own defining image of terror. In the 1970s, the word “terrorist” would conjure a mental picture of the angry young men of the IRA. Ask the woman on the Clapham omnibus what is meant by terror today and most will describe a young man of Middle Eastern or North African descent, alienated economically or socially from modern British life and embroiled in the dangerous ideology of radical Islamism. In short: a jihadi. That image is wrong. Police figures show that white people have already overtaken Asian suspects as the single largest ethnic group arrested on suspicion of terror offences in Britain. The number of people referred to the government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme for far-right extremism has risen by more than a third in just one year.
JAN1	As a Brexiteer, I hope 2019 will see us put aside our differences and find common ground	With 2019 now upon us, a friend just asked me what wish above all others would I like granted this new year. I did not need a nanosecond to consider, because it relates to the day we leave the EU on 29 March. But it will not be a day for triumphalism on the part of us Brexiteers: but instead, a day to show magnanimity and help heal our wounded nation.
JAN1	Don’t buy into the ‘new year, new you’ nonsense – no one magically sheds bad habits when the clock strikes 12	Walking into someone’s house and seeing “live, laugh, love” on their wall makes me want to gouge my eyeballs out with a fork. And over the years, I have had the same reaction to those who insist on writing “new year, new me” captions on the first day of a new year. Christmas is finally over and 2019 is here, which can only mean my Instagram feed is going to be flooded with essays about snazzy bullet journals, vowing to be happy and avoiding f***boys in 2019. Plans to stop procrastinating or to lose weight are often top of the list, as is turning vegan for a month.
JAN1	Elizabeth Warren’s ideals may appeal to left-leaning Democrats, but it’ll make her battle with Trump much harder	Elizabeth Warren knows a thing about hard work. Married at 19, pregnant shortly afterwards, she raised a child while attending law school. She then had a second child, passed the bar, and soon divorced. For a while she was a single parent, a story she likes to recount. “A turn here, a turn there, and my life might have been very different, too,” the Massachusetts senator wrote in A Fighting Chance, a 2014 memoir she published while considering a 2016 presidential run.
JAN1	A slow-burn US trade deal is no bad thing – for the UK at least	The US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, is quite right that a “massive” trade deal with between the two countries cannot be completed quickly if Theresa May’s exit agreement with the EU is agreed. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting the plan the prime minister has negotiated, which is merely about the exit terms rather than the future trading relations with the EU, and indeed with other countries. Ultimately it is in the self-interest of the UK, the US and the EU for there to be as near frictionless trade as possible between all three. The question is how best to get there from here.
JAN1	How disabled people like me suffer due to blue badge abuse and underfunded local authorities	A few months ago, a friend sent me a car sticker. Not a standard gift for your average 31-year-old girl-about-town, but it gave me a much needed laugh: “My Doctor Knows Why I Need a Disabled Parking Permit. You Don’t Need To.” Four years, one wheelchair and multiple colourful walking sticks since my diagnosis with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and I still haven’t worked out how to “look disabled”. Spontaneously dislocating joints, I have nailed. Juggling pain medications, fatigue and a career, I’m getting my head around.
JAN1	Why I'm not surprised that straight white man Louis CK is mocking young non-binary people like me	Even during Christmas season, it’s annoying to be called a snowflake. This time, it’s Louis CK throwing out the accusation, deeming young people who fight for a more tolerant society a PC-nuisance. In a leaked audio of a heinous recent comedy set, he is heard to be mocking gender non-conforming people for using the neutral they/them pronoun, as well as ridiculing the Parkland shooting survivors, “joking” that what they went through doesn’t make them “interesting”. He even jibes that young people should be partying instead of getting involved with politics.

JAN3	The anti-vaxx movement has reached peak stupidity – more than half of US parents believe immunisation causes the flu	Every winter, there is one issue that polarises opinion, particularly among parents – is the flu jab a good idea? No matter where I hear this issue being discussed, the same argument comes up over the false belief that getting the vaccine will give you flu.
JAN3	As an Afghan citizen, this is why I'm not worried that Trump is withdrawing his troops from my country	President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement about the withdrawal of half of American troops from Afghanistan has created mixed feelings among Afghans. Many fear that the withdrawal of US troops could lead to political instability, give the Taliban more power and thus see them recapture Kabul as they did in 1996, others are more hopeful their departure will facilitate peace talks.
JAN3	As a parent, I’m concerned about my kids’ screen time – but am I a hypocrite?	I am not, for the most part, a technophobe. True, I’m not at all convinced that technology has made our lives better in every respect (is anyone?) – but the balance is in its favour, across a whole range of measures in a multitude of sectors. And for the most part I know what I’m doing when it comes to electronic devices, though I’m always anxious about the possibility of breaking them (even if I rarely do). Nevertheless, I’m painfully conscious that I don’t have the intuitive grasp of everyday technology that is evident among those under the age of 30 who did not know a time before mobile phones. In fact, forget mobiles, before I went to university in 1997 I don’t think I knew what emails were.
JAN3	Don't mourn the death of CDs, but fear the cultural deluge that will drive people apart	Millennials get a lot of grief. They’re either fragile, frivolous or just infuriatingly young. This week came the shock realisation that everyone born in 2000 is now a fully-fledged Gen Z adult. The passing of time can catch you out like that. One thing we can’t accuse either generation of though, is propping up the ailing CD market. Sales fell again in 2018, by nearly a quarter. Streaming and downloads carry on chipping away at the edifice, and even vinyl, which has been cheered as the saviour of the physical music market, saw barely any growth at all.
JAN3	Judge Richard Goldstone suffered for turning his back on Gaza – but not as much as the Palestinians he betrayed	When a hero lets you down, the betrayal lasts forever. I’m not alone, I know, when I say that Richard Goldstone was a hero of mine – a most formidable, brilliant and brave judge who finally spoke truth to power in the Middle East. And then recanted like a frightened political prisoner, with protestations of love for the nation whose war crimes he so courageously exposed. Now, after years of virtual silence, the man who confronted Israel and Hamas with their unforgivable violence after the 2008-09 Gaza war has found a defender in a little known but eloquent academic. Judge Goldstone, a Jewish South African, was denounced by Israelis and their supporters as “evil” and a “quisling” after he listed the evidence of Israel’s brutality against the Palestinians of Gaza (around 1,300 dead, most of them civilians), and of Hamas’ numerically fewer crimes (13 Israeli dead, three of them civilians, plus a number of Palestinian “informer” executions).  Professor Daniel Terris, a Brandeis University scholar admired for his work on law and ethics, calls his new book The Trials of Richard Goldstone. Good title, but no cigar.  
JAN3	China's move to legalise use of rhino horn and tiger bones criticised	By Caroline Chebet for The Standard, Kenya Conservationists have criticised the Chinese government for lifting a 25-year-ban on rhino horn and tiger bone. China lifted the ban in October under new regulations that allow hospitals to obtain the parts from commercially bred tigers and rhinos for “medical research”. 
JAN3	Why stop at giving shipless start-ups contracts for ferries? Let’s have Greggs make Brexit planes too	Chris Grayling sure knows how to thump a tub. The Brexit-backing transport secretary has been out and about in the media saying he “makes no apology” for handing a £13.8m contract for the provision of extra ferries in the event he and his pals deliver up a no-deal Brexit to a company that has no ships and no trading history. And why should he? The transport secretary says he’s bally well backing Britain. Huzzah for that! He’s showing that can-do spirit New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, whom Donald Trump appointed as ambassador to Britain for some reason (clue: he’s a big Republican Party donor), says we need a little more of to sail off into the sunlit uplands. His team won four games this year, so we really should take heed.
JAN3	Don’t listen to the People’s Vote polling – most Labour members still back Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit	Labour’s Brexit policy of blocking Theresa May’s unpopular deal, ensuring no-deal doesn’t happen, and pursuing a general election to allow it to enter its own negotiations with the EU, hasn’t changed since September’s Labour conference, or, in principle, since the 2017 general election. Yet the turn of the new year has seen a spontaneous new wave of liberal comment attacking Jeremy Corbyn, claiming he’s betraying Labour members, and about to oversee an exodus of liberal Europhiles who will not forgive him for enabling Brexit. This is a suspiciously neat about-turn. Under Ed Miliband and in the first years of Corbyn, it was culturally conservative working-class voters who were allegedly on the cusp of abandoning Labour, usually because the party was said to be ignoring their “legitimate concerns” about immigration. As Joe Kennedy has argued in his recent book, Authentocrats, this claim was most often made by right-wing Labour figures, seeking to use the ventriloquised voice of “ordinary people” as a means of attacking any attempt to reposition the party to the left.
JAN3	Shameless Tory leadership hopefuls are using refugees in the English Channel to further their careers	Sajid Javid’s use of the migration “major incident” (it isn’t one) to further his party leadership campaign is growing embarrassing – both for its blatancy and for its collapse into farce. First, the number of predominantly Iranian refugees turning up on the south coast on dinghies is far too paltry to qualify for the panicky “major incident” label. Anyone would think that some amphibious assault on the scale of Hitler’s Operation Sea Lion was being unleashed on the shores of Kent. It is not.
JAN3	The home secretary’s reliance on xenophobic fear-mongering won’t help migrants – but seeking help from the EU might	 Sajid Javid’s response to the relatively small numbers of asylum seekers crossing the Channel has been disproportionate (“‘We will do everything we can’ to block asylum claims from Channel crossings”, News, yesterday). However, his more recent statement that the individuals concerned are not “genuine asylum seekers” is also misguided and in my mind, clearly aimed at whipping up anti-refugee rhetoric which increasingly translates into violence by far-right extremists.
JAN4	The fate of Gatwick and the failings of armed forces recruitment tell a sorry tale about a country that wanted to ‘take back control’	The closure of Gatwick, the second largest airport in Britain, just before Christmas after the sighting of a mysterious drone near the runway, received wall-to-wall coverage from the British media, dominating the news agenda for the best part of a week. Contrast this with the limited interest shown when a majority stake in the airport was sold by its owners to a French company. A consortium led by the US investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners, which included the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, were paid £2.9bn by the French group, Vinci Airports.
JAN4	North Korea’s ambassador to Italy is missing – it’s a useful reminder about the reality of Kim’s new-look DPRK	Only days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave his annual New Year’s address, news filtered through that the DPRK ambassador to Italy was missing. According to the latest reports Ambassador Jo Song-gil, the son-in-law of a high-level official in the regime, has been missing since November and is currently in hiding. News of Jo’s likely defection is embarrassing for the Kim regime, but more importantly it signals to the world that despite North Korea’s recent charm offensive, there is dissent within the country’s inner circles.
JAN4	The world is actually becoming a better place – and this is the data to prove it	Swedish academic Hans Rosling has identified a worrying trend: not only do many people across advanced economies have no idea that the world is becoming a much better place, but they actually even think the opposite. This is no wonder, when the news focuses on reporting catastrophes, terrorist attacks, wars and famines. Who wants to hear about the fact that every day some 200,000 people around the world are lifted above the US$2-a-day poverty line? Or that more than 300,000 people a day get access to electricity and clean water for the first time every day? These stories of people in low-income countries simply doesn’t make for exciting news coverage. But, as Rosling pointed out in his book Factfulness, it’s important to put all the bad news in perspective.
JAN4	Why the ‘food tsar’ will make a real difference to people in food poverty	Not before time, Britain has a “food tsar” – someone specifically tasked with reducing the colossal waste of food in this country. The equivalent of some 250 million meals are thrown away each year, at a time when many households are suffering food poverty and, children in particular, poor nutrition. Now we have someone who is tasked with doing something about it – Ben Elliot, the government’s first food surplus and waste champion. Because of his privileged background and his business, Quintessentially, which caters to well-off people, some have questioned Ben’s commitment to the cause. They could not be more wrong. As someone who has got to know Ben over the last year, and is a fellow volunteer at food waste charity The Felix Project, I know that he will bring enormous energy and urgency to his unpaid role, with a belief that this waste of good, fresh food is a national scandal. As Ben has said: “As a nation, we need to stop this excessive waste and ensure that surplus food finds its way to people in our society who need it most, and not let it get thrown away and go to landfill.”
JAN4	Mea Culpa: Questions to which the answer is, ‘You tell me’	I have written a whole book about headlines in the form of Questions To Which The Answer Is No, but there are other headlines posed as questions that are equally deserving of gentle mockery. Generally, this kind of article should either tell the reader the answer to a question, or at least teasingly suggest that the answer might not be the one the reader is expecting.  Otherwise the reader might just think, to take some recent examples, “I don’t know, why is there hostility to a US exit from Syria? How did the deadly Indonesia tsunami creep past early warning systems? Why does everyone think Muslims hate Christmas?” 
JAN4	Don't mourn the death of CDs, but fear the cultural deluge that will drive people apart	Millennials get a lot of grief. They’re either fragile, frivolous or just infuriatingly young.

JAN4	Like Ellen DeGeneres, I believe in forgiveness – but I'm disappointed she's played to Kevin Hart's victim narrative	Before 2019’s Hollywood awards season had even begun, it risked being overshadowed by a controversy surrounding Academy Awards host Kevin Hart. After his hosting gig was announced, “jokes” made by Hart on Twitter 2011 resurfaced online. Hart, who was set to become the fourth African American to host the biggest night in Hollywood, said that he would “break” a toy over his son’s head if he played with “gay” toys like dolls.
JAN4	Theresa May is banking on the EU to save her deal – but a distracted Europe has bigger fish to fry	Is he a friend or foe? Jean-Claude Juncker is portrayed by much of the UK media as the enemy. Theresa May rebuked him at last month’s EU summit for saying her demands were “nebulous”. And yet, surprisingly, Downing Street is hopeful Juncker will prove the friend May desperately needs to save her ailing Brexit deal. Juncker wants to help May win round the Democratic Unionist Party which, despite talks with the prime minister yesterday, remains strongly opposed to the backstop to prevent a hard Irish border. 
JAN4	Donald Trump may have met his match in Nancy Pelosi	There is something irresistibly attractive, delicious even, about having Nancy Pelosi – a liberal Democrat and a woman – pitted against Donald Trump, the populist, misogynist egotist. As the new speaker of the House of Representatives, she acts as a formidable political force in her own right – with the House now controlled by her party – and a personalised riposte to Trumpism. As she stated so forthrightly in her inaugural address, she is determined to protect the rights and powers of the legislative branch of American government, “co-equal” with the president’s executive branch and the judiciary. This week, she has already found herself embroiled in her first war of attrition with President Trump – over the partial shutdown of the federal government.
JAN4	If Theresa May had any power, Chris Grayling would have been fired by now	There is a saying that people are promoted to their own level of incompetence. This maxim is especially applicable to Chris Grayling. Last year, he presided over chaos over the rail timetable changes and the worst record in train delays and cancellations for well over a decade. This week we discover that his department has awarded a £13m contract to a company that has never run a ferry to run a ferry service in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  In any other walk of business he would have been dismissed but his loyalty to Theresa May and the fact that he ran her leadership campaign are the reasons why he is still in post. What a pitiful state of affairs.
JAN5	How to sound like you know what you’re talking about on Brexit in 2019	Brexit is set to dominate our conversations for some time to come. There’s a risk that it falls into the religion, sex and politics “no-go” area at dinner parties. But it’s really unavoidable; it’ll sit there like the elephant in the room, lurking ominously, and it’s best you understand how to approach it sensitively around your aperitifs if you don’t want it to trample in unannounced. As it may already have done over the Christmas break. Here’s a guide on how to sound credible and avoid offence in discussing the topic, ahem, du jour, in the weeks and months ahead. 
JAN5	The fate of Gatwick and the failings of armed forces recruitment tell a sorry tale about a country that wanted to ‘take back control’	The closure of Gatwick, the second largest airport in Britain, just before Christmas after the sighting of a mysterious drone near the runway, received wall-to-wall coverage from the British media, dominating the news agenda for the best part of a week. Contrast this with the limited interest shown when a majority stake in the airport was sold by its owners to a French company. A consortium led by the US investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners, which included the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, were paid £2.9bn by the French group, Vinci Airports.
JAN5	Being a black woman on the internet is hard – so it’s OK for us to disengage sometimes	Social media, Twitter in particular, can be a real treasure trove. This last few months alone saw us all drawn into the photoshopped romance between writer Bolu Babalola and Michael B Jordan, Black Twitter single-handedly drum up unprecedented interest in Bird Box, and the platform continued to be a hotbed of promoted job opportunities.  The ideal place for bite-size updates on popular culture and breaking news, Twitter has been credited for “shaping news around events and social unrest both near and far”, with more people now choosing to consume news through social media. However, it’s the very relentless nature of the website that also makes it an increasingly dark place to exist, particularly when the news cycles about abuse, mistreatment, and murders involve black women.
JAN5	The world's museums are in a Twitter battle over who has the best duck artefacts – time to declare the winner	Sometimes the internet is a lovely place to be. On Friday afternoon the Museum of English Rural Life issued a direct and intriguing Twitter challenge to one of its far more illustrious peers. “hey @britishmuseum give us your best duck”
JAN5	Baby leave rules are a test of parliament’s commitment to equal rights	Video footage of Jeremy Corbyn was unearthed this week, dividing opinion on social media. It was of him as a Labour backbencher in 1994, acting as a teller for a vote in the House of Commons on a frivolous question put by a Conservative MP, proposing to ban French words in retaliation for an edict by the French authorities against English ones.  The disagreement arose, not over the silliness of the motion, but over Mr Corbyn’s refusal to bow in the direction of the speaker’s chair, as tellers traditionally do. For some, this was a failure to show respect for the institution of democracy; for others, it was justified stand against ritual and flummery. 
JAN5	Why in the age of the internet the British army needs the ‘snowflake generation’ more than ever	The British army’s latest recruitment campaign launched this week has been greeted with mixed opinion. The campaign targets the “snowflakes”, “selfie addicts” and “binge gamers” of Generation Z by overturning the negative stereotypes of their generation, translating these into qualities that are needed in the army, such as compassion, confidence and self-belief. However, critics have suggested that these adverts are appealing to people who are unsuited to the battlefield. Arguing that “snowflakes” are too vulnerable, “selfie addicts” insecure, and “gamers” too lazy. I disagree.  The campaign uses posters in the style of the famous “Your Country Needs You” Lord Kitchener First World War image, to demonstrate that the army needs the compassion of “snowflakes”, confidence of “selfie addicts”, and self-belief of “me me me millennials”. This follows last year’s “This is belonging” campaign which was built around a message of inclusiveness; and highlights the changing shift in emphasis in recruitment into the modern British army. This is not just a numbers game, the skills required in modern military operations have changed.
JAN5	The letters that could spell the end of Brexit if the people are given a Final Say	With British MPs likely to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal as well as any alternative form of Brexit, it is becoming more and more likely that the British electorate will get a Final Say. The trend in public opinion is pretty clear. If the people are asked whether they still want to quit the EU then in all likelihood they will say that they don’t. So what would happen next?
JAN5	The national outrage over the Channel migrant crossings is bizarre	While I agree that the migrant issue points to flaws in the UK’s national security and raises the question as to why our defence and security is geared towards prominent, international operations rather than our own defence, I would also point out that I feel this “major incident” is being exaggerated. It is not to be ignored that immigration to the UK can have major socioeconomic benefits, and even if it didn’t, is 200 or so immigrants over the past 2 months really a cause for national outrage?
JAN5	Donald Trump may have met his match in Nancy Pelosi	There is something irresistibly attractive, delicious even, about having Nancy Pelosi – a liberal Democrat and a woman – pitted against Donald Trump, the populist, misogynist egotist. As the new speaker of the House of Representatives, she acts as a formidable political force in her own right – with the House now controlled by her party – and a personalised riposte to Trumpism.

What a pitiful state of affairs.
JAN6	With a possible government shutdown on the horizon, could John Bercow steer us clear of the iceberg of Brexit?	It has taken almost 30 years for this American fad to cross the Atlantic, which is almost 30 years longer than the average, and there’s no guarantee it will complete the journey now. But there is at least the chance that the US fashion for the government shutdown, as inaugurated in Washington back in 1980 and newly resurrected by President Doolally J Twathead, is preparing to visit.
JAN6	Diversity doesn’t always mean positive change – but the new congress gives me hope	There is hope again for US politics. Not only was there, thank God, a democratic takeover of the House of Representatives with 235 Democrats and 199 Republicans, with one congressional race outcome in North Carolina still pending. But even more important: there are now 102 women in the 116th congress, more than ever before in the history of the country. But diversity doesn’t always mean change. And in the face of the Trump administration’s rollbacks on everything imaginable: from human rights to environmental law and immigration law – the US needed not only a diverse group of congresswomen to make a change, but also an infusion of bold congresswomen to stand up to the bully, racist and misogynist-in-chief, Donald Trump.
JAN6	As someone who’s recovered from an eating disorder, I dread the expectation to change something about myself every January	I suffered from anorexia between the ages of 19 and 21. The January “health kick” period was my saving grace. No one would question when I would nibble meekly on the end of a wilted spinach leaf for lunch. No one would bat an eyelid when I would over-exercise and, of course, the weather was the perfect excuse to hide behind baggy jumpers, so no one would realise how frail I’d become. As tradition dictates, the new year is a time when people make new goals to “better” themselves over the next 12 months. These goals are often shaped around dieting and fitness.
JAN6	The world's museums are in a Twitter battle over who has the best duck artefacts – time to declare the winner	Sometimes the internet is a lovely place to be. On Friday afternoon the Museum of English Rural Life issued a direct and intriguing Twitter challenge to one of its far more illustrious peers. “hey @britishmuseum give us your best duck”
JAN6	Baby leave rules are a test of parliament’s commitment to equal rights	Video footage of Jeremy Corbyn was unearthed this week, dividing opinion on social media. It was of him as a Labour backbencher in 1994, acting as a teller for a vote in the House of Commons on a frivolous question put by a Conservative MP, proposing to ban French words in retaliation for an edict by the French authorities against English ones.  The disagreement arose, not over the silliness of the motion, but over Mr Corbyn’s refusal to bow in the direction of the speaker’s chair, as tellers traditionally do. For some, this was a failure to show respect for the institution of democracy; for others, it was justified stand against ritual and flummery. 
JAN6	Being a black woman on the internet is hard – so it’s OK for us to disengage sometimes	Social media, Twitter in particular, can be a real treasure trove. This last few months alone saw us all drawn into the photoshopped romance between writer Bolu Babalola and Michael B Jordan, Black Twitter single-handedly drum up unprecedented interest in Bird Box, and the platform continued to be a hotbed of promoted job opportunities.  The ideal place for bite-size updates on popular culture and breaking news, Twitter has been credited for “shaping news around events and social unrest both near and far”, with more people now choosing to consume news through social media. However, it’s the very relentless nature of the website that also makes it an increasingly dark place to exist, particularly when the news cycles about abuse, mistreatment, and murders involve black women.
JAN6	Britons are overwhelmingly swayed by myths about immigration – these are the five facts we often get wrong	Immigration led the headlines again over the holiday season. Around 100 migrants were found on beaches or rescued from boats in the English Channel, sparking talk of a “crisis” and “major incident” and leading the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to cut short his Christmas break to chair a meeting with senior officials at the Border Agency and National Crime Agency. It’s yet another example of how coverage of migration in the media and political rhetoric run way ahead of the reality, and fuel misperceptions about the scale, nature and impact of the issue.
JAN6	China’s brutal crackdown on Uighurs shows no sign of slowing down – so why aren’t Muslim leaders stepping in?	Having endured the brunt of the US military machine for decades, the Muslim world is today confronted with another leviathan forcibly seeking its political acquiescence: China. The People’s Republic is currently pursuing an unprecedented crackdown on the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, previously East Turkestan, for whom the region has become a real-life dystopia.
JAN6	With only 10 days at her disposal, it’s safe to say it’s not looking good for Theresa May’s Brexit deal	With 82 days to go until the Brexit deadline bell strikes, the prime minister has returned from her Christmas break insisting that MPs will be given a meaningful vote on her deal in the next 10 days. 15 or 16 January appears the most likely date. Theresa May’s confirmation that a division will indeed take place follows days of speculation that there might be a further delay, with sources indicating that the parliamentary maths is still not in the PM’s favour.
JAN6	Theresa May already had a chance to bring 'world class care' to the NHS – she failed	Forgive me if I don’t put much stead in Theresa May’s promise to build a world class health service. Firstly, she’s broken so many other promises, and secondly, it’s exactly what any politician in her position would say.
JAN7	A no-deal Brexit would breach the UK’s own human rights laws – here’s how	Suicides will rise. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has reportedly acknowledged that he cannot guarantee people will not die. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police accepted that the public will be put at risk. Fridges are being purchased on an industrial scale in order to help with the stockpiling of medicines. It’s unclear how many fridges we will need to ensure an uninterrupted supply. However, this doesn’t help those who need easy access to lifesaving medicines that cannot be stored. The Home Office has warned of a breakdown in law and order. To protect life, troops might have to be brought in. These are just some of the scenarios that will occur in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
JAN7	Yes, the government’s 10-year plan will help the NHS – but no party can turn it into the service we imagine	With Brexit entering end-game territory, it is easy to overlook the fact that there are other policy priorities for the government and the country. Today, the NHS gets a brief moment in the headlines, with the publication of a 10-year plan drawn up at the prime minister’s request. Those responsible for the proposals argue they will help to save up to half a million lives.
JAN7	People expect schools to heal the ills of society – no wonder there’s so much stress in education	James Moore’s heartfelt and personal account of the staffing crisis facing education will be recognised by many who work in schools and by those who have subsequently moved on to something else. Behind each example of a teacher leaving the profession is a backstory. For many this will involve months, maybe years, of unhappiness, falling confidence, exhaustion and, for some, serious mental health problems. Of course, not only the teacher is affected during this period of secret misery, because children too are denied confident professionals.
JAN7	We have enough men dominating travel shows and art galleries – when will women get a chance?	A tweet caught my eye the other day: apparently in London’s National Gallery there are only around 20 works of art by female artists in its entire collection, plus four additional pieces currently on loan. To add insult to injury, according to the website, amongst the top 30 “must see” paintings, none are by women. This is depressing, but not surprising – the National Gallery tends to be all about the classics. I usually avoid the place – so many horses, so many bleeding martyrs – but I do love the fabulous mosaics in the entrance hall and they’ve got a nice little collection of Impressionist works courtesy of the Courtauld at the moment. Plus it’s free, which is always a bonus.
JAN7	As someone who’s recovered from an eating disorder, I dread the expectation to change something about myself every January	I suffered from anorexia between the ages of 19 and 21. The January “health kick” period was my saving grace. No one would question when I would nibble meekly on the end of a wilted spinach leaf for lunch. No one would bat an eyelid when I would over-exercise and, of course, the weather was the perfect excuse to hide behind baggy jumpers, so no one would realise how frail I’d become. As tradition dictates, the new year is a time when people make new goals to “better” themselves over the next 12 months. These goals are often shaped around dieting and fitness.
JAN7	Jack Monroe's openness about struggling with alcohol is invaluable – we don’t talk about battling the early stages often enough	For food writer Jack Monroe, the new year has started with an honest and open account of her struggles with alcoholism. Her piece in The Guardian, which she describes as her “mea culpa”. was striking for two reasons. Firstly, alcohol and drug problems still carry too much shame. Although the mental health conversation has progressed significantly, the topic of addiction often isn’t invited to the stigma-busting table. As such, there is a lack of understanding and a culture of blame around it.
JAN7	Abortion for a select few wasn’t the goal when we campaigned to repeal the eighth – but that’s exactly what’s happening	In May of last year, when Ireland voted for legalisation of abortion in its historic referendum, pro-choice campaigners on both sides of the Northern Irish-Irish border celebrated. The campaign to repeal the eighth amendment (the law that previously made abortion illegal in Ireland) had begun as a grassroots movement, culminating in a mass cultural shift led by both Irish and Northern Irish activists. Many in the north, particularly those in border counties, canvassed in the republic, held fundraisers and rallies, and threw themselves behind pushing for a Yes vote despite not being able to vote in the referendum themselves. The landslide vote to repeal Ireland’s archaic abortion laws was an emotional and monumental moment for pro-choice campaigners both sides of the border. For Northern Irish campaigners, repealing the eighth amendment marked what felt like a watershed moment for the inevitable decriminalisation of abortion in the north.
JAN7	To frighten the EU into believing we are serious about no-deal Brexit, the country has staged a fake traffic jam all the way to Dover	The darkness rose like a theatre curtain over the Kent horizon and what the gathered audience saw was a piece of national performance art that will echo down the ages. There was Britain, standing fully naked in a disused airfield, drawing over itself in felt tip pen, pointing at its pale puckered flesh and howling like an illegal Eighties raver at the apex of an MDMA overdose.
JAN7	Saudi Arabia's grim discrimination against women is exposed by Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun's startling bravery	The case of 18-year-old asylum seeker, Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun from Saudi Arabia who has been held since Sunday against her will at Bangkok airport sheds a welcome light on the plight of women in Saudi Arabia. Following Rahaf’s plea for help to the UN, she has finally been granted UNCR refugee access at Bangkok airport “to assess her need for international refugee protection and find an immediate solution for her situation.”
JAN7	The government’s 10-year NHS plan is welcome – but a shift in public opinion is needed if we are to save it	It would be perverse indeed to deride a government pledge to provide certainty in funding, clinical priorities and administration for the National Health Service into the 2030s. A half a million lives saved through preventing diseases, such as strokes, heart problems and cancer cannot be dismissed as mere spin. Theresa May has announced a serious piece of policy, and it deserves serious attention. Long-term stability is, after all, what the health think tanks, every political party, every health workers’ union and every royal college has been demanding for many years. Yes, the announcement has been delayed – for reasons that can only be guessed at – but the midwife has been called and the government’s latest policy baby has enjoyed a healthy birth. Although the plan only applies to NHS England, as a devolved sphere of policy, similar plans will emerge from the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, matching new funds with new priorities.
JAN8	I was abused with Anna Soubry outside parliament, and I can tell you the protests had nothing to do with free speech	For viewers at home, the visual cues on television news are clear: if stations are broadcasting outside, it means we’re in the midst of a political crisis and a particularly big story. Nowadays, as Brexit looms ever closer, the crisis seems permanent. There’s no pressing need to film political interviews outside, but the parliamentary backdrop adds an ambience, and the hubbub of politicians and journalists in the background provides a sense of the commotion felt in Westminster. Part of that excitement has – until now – been the protestors, some of whom are there almost every day. Before I was old enough to vote, Brian Haw camped out on Parliament Square, and since the 2016 referendum a gaggle of protestors has attempted to edge into camera shots with placards and slogan T-shirts. At worst, they have been a mild irritation, but a regular fixture that few broadcasters begrudge.
JAN8	Yes, let’s build more social housing – and show that we’ve learned the lessons of the Grenfell tragedy	David Lloyd George never actually promised “homes fit for heroes” after the First World War. The Liberal prime minister’s pledge was that his coalition government would construct “habitations fit for the heroes who have won the war”.
JAN8	Turkey’s Erdogan is one of the biggest threats to peace in the Middle East – the sooner the US realises the better	This week, United States national security advisor John Bolton said American military personnel would not leave Syria until an agreement was reached in Turkey to protect the Syrian Kurds. At a time where US policy in that region changes day by day, the veracity of his statement is uncertain – but Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken it as a declaration of war, refusing to meet with Bolton and threatening that Turkish forces could move into Syria “as soon as the meeting is over.” That a simple offer of protection for the forces who have formed the United States’ most effective allies against ISIS would spur such a response shows how far the two countries have diverged, even as Turkish officials take the promised withdrawal as a positive step. It also highlights an inconvenient reality: Erdogan is only intervening in Syria to attack Kurdish self-government and consolidate domestic support.
JAN8	Heathrow drone chaos reveals Britain's stretched and fragile airport infrastructure	“We have resumed departures out of Heathrow following a short suspension,” a spokesperson for Europe’s busiest airport said at 6.34pm on Tuesday. Take-offs from the northern runway at Heathrow were suspended for barely an hour, compared with the 33-hour closure of Gatwick airport immediately before Christmas.
JAN8	Taking too many photos could be ruining our memories – and this is why	Last year I visited the Hermitage in St Petersburg, Russia – one of the best art museums in the world. I was expecting to serenely experience its masterpieces, but my view was blocked by a wall of smart phones taking pictures of the paintings. And where I could find a bit of empty space, there were people taking selfies to create lasting memories of their visit. For many people, taking hundreds, if not thousands, of pictures is now a crucial part of going on holiday – documenting every last detail and posting it on social media. But how does that affect our actual memories of the past – and how we view ourselves? As an expert on memory, I was curious.
JAN8	People expect schools to heal the ills of society – no wonder there’s so much stress in education	James Moore’s heartfelt and personal account of the staffing crisis facing education will be recognised by many who work in schools and by those who have subsequently moved on to something else. Behind each example of a teacher leaving the profession is a backstory. For many this will involve months, maybe years, of unhappiness, falling confidence, exhaustion and, for some, serious mental health problems. Of course, not only the teacher is affected during this period of secret misery, because children too are denied confident professionals.
JAN8	Reactions to this photo of eggs benedict from Tesco cafe show just how rife middle class food snobbery has become	Eggs benedict is a peerless dish that has stubbornly remained on brunch menus since its inception in the 19th century – invented either by chef Charles Ranhofer at Delmonico’s restaurant in New York, or by Oscar Tschirky, maître d’hôtel at The Waldorf in the same city, depending on which story you want to believe. Either way, it was born in the realm of the upper class, but over time has been democratised. It has lent itself to subtle tweaks and updates, but the basic recipe remains the same: a toasted English muffin, ham, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce.  That is exactly the dish that was placed in front of Thomas Hesketh at a Tesco cafe in Wigan, and yet obviously, the result feels a long way from a swanky New York hotel’s version. I mean – the ham looks fine, but there’s not much hollandaise and the eggs do have an odd, milky-white residue around them. Cue a tweet to Tesco, immediate virality and everyone pulling out their best John and Gregg impressions on Twitter. 
JAN8	Chris Grayling’s defence of the Seaborne Freight contract was the most risible thing I have ever heard said in the House of Commons	The satirist concedes defeat when he has to deploy what is known in the news business as a “straight intro”, but once again Chris Grayling has got the better of us so, with a real sense of sadness, here goes... On Tuesday lunchtime, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, was called to the despatch box of the House of Commons to face questions about why he had awarded a £14m shipping contract to a company that does not own any ships, whose registered assets total £66, and whose terms and conditions of business turned out to have been copied and pasted from a takeaway delivery website.
JAN8	In the Princess Latifa affair, Mary Robinson has willingly tarnished her reputation for Dubai’s regime	There’s a saying in show business that you can spend 20 years becoming an overnight star. In politics, the same is true in reverse, as the sad case of Mary Robinson and Princess Latifa of Dubai shows. In a world of Trump, Le Pen, Salvini, Bolsonaro and numerous others, the likes of Robinson have stood out as beacons of hope. To the world outside Ireland, she distinguished herself in her seven years as president, and went on to serve five years as the UN high commissioner for human rights. As a young law student at Southampton University, she was someone I found inspiring.
JAN8	We should not allow the threat of violence to obstruct our democracy	There are many powerful democratic arguments in favour of a second, Final Say, referendum on Brexit. There are also many perfectly legitimate reasons to object to such an exercise. They have been widely aired. What is, however, not an acceptable way of opposing a further vote on Brexit is to threaten violent action, however obliquely.  Consciously or not, too many in senior political positions who should know better have been doing just this. The most recent example has dropped from the lips of the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. Commenting on the violent verbal abuse hurled at Remainer Tory MP Anna Soubry, Mr Barclay said the incident showed how “divisive” the Brexit debate had become. He then elided that point into another, adding that holding a second EU referendum to break the Brexit deadlock would be “hugely damaging to our democracy; to our politics”.
JAN9	Even if parliament ‘takes control’ of Brexit, it will still have to choose	The prime minister has lost another vote in the House of Commons. For a long time after the election stripped her of a majority, she and her whips were able to avoid defeats, mainly by not taking part in votes that didn’t matter and by postponing votes that did.  Now she is running out of time and cannot put off the crucial votes on Brexit. So yesterday she lost a vote on an amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper, Labour, designed to show parliament’s opposition to leaving the EU without an agreement. Today she lost a vote on an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve, Conservative rebel, to set a new timetable for approving her Brexit deal. 
JAN9	Can Donald Trump really afford to jettison his economic policy over the Mexican border wall?	Going through security at Tampa airport just before new year, I realised something: these people are not being paid. For Britons and Europeans this is bizarre. Even Venezuelan government employees get paid, though the money may not be worth much when they come to spend it. While government shut-downs are common in the US, this one may be of a different order of duration. Here’s why... Donald Trump’s instincts are those of a property developer and TV show host. We saw the first just before Christmas when he urged the Federal Reserve not to increase interest rates, for developers like cheap money. It didn’t work: the Fed went ahead. If it slows the pace at which rates rise this year it will be because of the data on the US economy, not presidential pressure.
JAN9	Anger at Yann Moix’s sexist remarks show that the patriarchy is finally crumbling in France – it took long enough	Yann Moix is the author of a dozen novels and has won literary prizes, but he is perhaps best known as a speaker on popular late night talk shows, where he delivers scathing criticism of his guests. In the last few years, Moix has carefully nurtured his reputation as a public provocateur and regularly makes headlines for his altercations with various actors and writers – who often happen to be women. Now Moix is at the heart of a new controversy. In an interview with Marie Claire on 4 January, the 50-year-old writer declared himself to be “incapable of loving women over 50”.
JAN9	Yes, we have seen chaos before – but the mood of the country is darker now	Splendid Editor’s Letter from Sean O’Grady (“We’re on the brink of chaos – but we’ve been here before”). I cannot agree more with the sentiment, it is surely sobering to reflect on such trauma in the past. From my personal experience, I used to work next door to Harrods – luckily I missed the explosion by nine years – and I remember the harrowing stories from those present, plus the still present bomb-retardant material on the windows.
JAN9	Northern Ireland has now been without a government for 2 years – enough is enough	A lot has happened since 9 January 2017. Donald Trump took office, and we saw the end of Mugabe and the Castros. North Korea raged, Grenfell burned and #MeToo rocked Hollywood. We’ve had three terror attacks, a Royal wedding and a Royal baby, one disastrous general election and a Brexit deal (for now). 
JAN9	Yes, let’s build more social housing – and show that we’ve learned the lessons of the Grenfell tragedy	David Lloyd George never actually promised “homes fit for heroes” after the First World War. The Liberal prime minister’s pledge was that his coalition government would construct “habitations fit for the heroes who have won the war”.
JAN9	I know the real reason why the gender pay gap has widened since bankers' salaries were first published	Reaching into Canary Wharf’s frosty January sky at 8 Canada Square, HSBC’s striking headquarters are a symbol of financial prowess and persistence. But slowly the mighty construction may well be morphing into a token of the merciless patriarchy too. This week, a year after being forced to out itself as the UK bank with the largest average gender pay gap, the organisation’s top executives have reason to hang their heads in shame and think a little more carefully about what their most noble new year’s resolution should be. 
JAN9	Hopeless Brexit planning has left Britain at risk from a new wave of terrorists	Largely unnoticed in the 2018 political chaos was a House of Commons Home Affairs Committee report on the security consequences of Brexit. In deeply concerned tones, the committee concluded that the government had not prepared sufficiently for the potential domestic security implications of Britain's departure from the EU. Against a backdrop of lone actor plots across the continent and growing right-wing extremism, this is not good enough. The terror threat remains as diffuse and transnational as ever.
JAN9	Delaying Article 50 is the only option left on the table for Theresa May	Any curious member of the public with an interest in the future of the country who followed proceedings in the House of the Commons today would be excused for wondering what on earth was going on. Having sat through the usual banter at prime minister’s questions, there was supposed to be the “great debate” about the government’s agreement with the EU. In that context, the viewer might have come prepared to endure some challengingly abstruse arguments about the differences between, say, “the” and “a” customs union, or the constitutional novelty of the “Stormont Lock”, or whether and how Article 50 might be paused or revoked, and much more besides. All necessarily difficult, but all obviously vital.
JAN9	Don't be distracted by violence on the fringes of European politics, the far right are taking over by legitimate means too	Far-right yobs yelling abuse and threatening MPs and journalists in Westminster. The gilets jaunes, a rag bag of populists and discontents, burning the streets of Paris. A far-right German MP beaten up in Bremen. Nothing to trivialise there. And yet none, even taken together, and even with several degrees of escalation, seriously threaten the future of European liberal values. But there is a much more lethal threat to European democracy – from the ballot box itself, and it will soon enough be upon us.
JAN10	The US media has lost one of its sanest voices on military matters – so let's hope William Arkin's absence is brief	I hate television “experts”, the infamous “analysts” who know all – and support all – about the military, the televisual ex-generals with vain presidential ambitions and the infamous American “think tank” personnel whose right-wing, pro-Israeli beliefs are carefully shielded from viewers by the US networks who employ them. I always characterise the antiseptic and pseudo-academic institutions to which they belong as the “Institute for Preposterous Affairs”.  The Fisk “IPA” contains hundreds of robotic folk who will churn out claptrap about “key players”, “stakeholders” and “moderate allies” and, of course, “world terror”. They turn up on CNN, Fox and Russia Today. And, of course, the BBC.
JAN10	The Rachel Riley Twitter row over antisemitism is just another glimpse of Team Corbyn’s flawed and fatal logic	The closing scene of the Werner Herzog movie Aguirre, The Wrath of God is a gift for any writer in search of a metaphor. It is a study in futile ambition and abject failure. This week, a phalanx of Jeremy Corbyn supporters brought it immediately to mind. In the 1972 classic, the famously unhinged actor Klaus Kinski plays Don Lope de Aguirre, a conquistador fiercely determined to discover the mythical City of Gold. He is relentless; willing to brutally discard the disloyal or those who lack his maniacal desire
JAN10	Stop sweeping poor-quality care for people with learning disabilities under the rug	The number of children with a learning disability or autism detained in institutions has more than doubled since 2015. We challenge the NHS’s explanation that this is due to changes in data collection – we’ve heard too many stories of people being restrained to believe it. For far too long people with learning disabilities have been unnecessarily detained in institutions, denied access to the quality of care they deserve.
JAN10	Kate Bush's disassociation with the Tories shows how out of touch they’ve become in the last two years	 
JAN10	The UK’s top judge had the audacity to criticise Tory austerity – and nobody's listening	Fed up with the way the elite’s been carrying on? Just wait until you hear this: we’ve discovered that Britain’s most senior judge is among the cappuccino quaffing, north London liberals who are bringing this great nation down. Lady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, proved she’s nothing less than an enemy of the people when she laid into the effect of austerity on families, women, disabled people and minorities in a speech about human rights and family life to the Isle of Man Law Society. 
JAN10	Anger at Yann Moix’s sexist remarks show that the patriarchy is finally crumbling in France – it took long enough	Yann Moix is the author of a dozen novels and has won literary prizes, but he is perhaps best known as a speaker on popular late night talk shows, where he delivers scathing criticism of his guests. In the last few years, Moix has carefully nurtured his reputation as a public provocateur and regularly makes headlines for his altercations with various actors and writers – who often happen to be women. Now Moix is at the heart of a new controversy. In an interview with Marie Claire on 4 January, the 50-year-old writer declared himself to be “incapable of loving women over 50”.
JAN10	Theresa May should bring up Japan’s grotesque whaling practices when she meets Shinzo Abe	People who kill whales say they’d stop immediately if these glorious sea mammals could scream. “Nobody would be able to stand it”. Even without screams, the reality of 21st-century whaling is horrific. The whales are chased until they are exhausted. They are caught using grenade-armed harpoons which explode inside the whales. Then their bodies, many of which will still be alive, are dragged to the ship.
JAN10	I asked Theresa May if she sides with Putin or the people – an answer would tell us who Brexit is really for	For all the farcical invoking of Blitz spirit, Brexit isn’t merely an absurdist experiment in English nationalist nostalgia – it is the most audacious example yet of a futuristic Russian nationalism that seeks to divide and rule Europe. If we can be judged by our friends then Brexit has no stauncher ally than Vladimir Putin. After all, Donald Trump has proved unreliable. 
JAN10	When will queer black lives matter to the masses?	Centuries of advocacy, bravery and, sadly, many deaths have brought the modern world in to a time where black liberation is no longer a mythical theory whispered in quiet corners, but an active goal whose path is being created by groups of people willing to chip away and put the spotlight on the systemic and global oppression experienced by black people over centuries. Despite the constant work of and the growing platforms many black Americans have today, in the era of Black Lives Matter and heightened social awareness, black lives remain undervalued as we become desensitized to the continuing trauma inflicted upon black communities.
JAN10	This is what it feels like to work without pay because of Donald Trump's US government shutdown	I encountered my first government shutdown after moving to America in 2013. As a Brit, I didn’t entirely understand what “shutdown” meant. Surely it was impossible for the civil service to just stop working? At the time, I classified the shutdown over healthcare reform as one of the minor annoyances of American life, alongside needing ID to buy alcohol and calculating an appropriate tip.
JAN11	Theresa May has finally realised she desperately needs Labour's backing on Brexit – here's how she could secure it	Theresa May’s appeal to Labour backbenchers and trade union leaders to rescue her unloved Brexit deal is desperate, very late in the day and long overdue.  She could and should have already built a cross-party alliance for a soft Brexit – either in 2016 when she became prime minister (to represent the 48 per cent, instead of treating the 52 per cent as if they were 100 per cent) or after the 2017 election (to recognise the parliamentary arithmetic against a hard Brexit that has now belatedly dawned on her).
JAN11	Yes, Andy Murray is a decent feminist ally, but tackling sexism in sport will take a lot more than one outspoken tennis player	This morning I was greeted by the news that Andy Murray was retiring from tennis by the end of Wimbledon, if not before. It means the loss of a great tennis player, but  – as many have pointed out – it also means the loss of a vocal feminist male tennis player. Billie Jean King, 12-time grand slam champion and early proponent of women’s tennis tweeted: “You are a champion on and off the court. So sorry you cannot retire on your own terms, but remember to look to the future. Your greatest impact on the world may be yet to come. Your voice for equality will inspire future generations. Much love to you & your family.”
JAN11	From the Brexity bunch to hardline outsiders: A guide to the Tory cabinet factions	Theresa May is losing control of her cabinet. As ministers jostle to succeed her, the cabinet appears to have split three ways.  Here John Rentoul looks at the factions within the government, the bookmakers on ministers taking the top job and the percentage of support they have among Conservative Party members. 
JAN11	Amber Rudd has done the right thing by not extending the two child benefit cap, but universal credit has failed	When it was launched by Iain Duncan Smith in 2010, a seeming political lifetime ago, universal credit had three main, interconnected, aims, all perfectly laudable. First it was supposed to simplify the complicated and overlapping webs of benefits regimes that had grown up under the welfare state. Second, it was supposed to save the state money in the process – fair to taxpayers and to benefits claimants. Third, the economy as a whole was designed to benefit from the guiding principle that no one should be better off on social security than in work. With tax credits, New Labour and Gordon Brown had implemented some reforms that moved policy in that direction. This was to be a much more ambitious exercise.  It has failed, on all three counts. That much has been known and, from time to time, even acknowledged by ministers for years. Amber Rudd’s radical further reforms to the system represent a more candid and fundamental admission of crisis. She is, she says, seeking to bring a more “compassionate” approach. The arbitrary rules about the child element of benefit after the second child are being abolished; payments will be made to the principal carer, usually the woman, so reducing the abuse of the system by bullying or irresponsible male partners; and she has massively slowed the transfer of claimants into the scheme – a few thousands rather than the 3 million originally scheduled. 
JAN11	Theresa May’s hypocrisy has reached new heights if she’s really trying to win over union leaders	As a lifelong active trade unionist and shop steward I laughed out loud at the news Theresa May was grovelling before the very union leaders she has previously treated with contempt, in a desperate attempt to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament. For decades now trade unions have been fettered by draconian anti-union legislation introduced and sustained by the Conservative Party which May leads. Only now we are supposed to believe that May – who has generally voted against laws to promote equality and human rights in her parliamentary career – now cares about workers’ rights.
JAN11	Theresa May tried to convince the unions of her Brexit deal today – it went terribly, and let’s hope it gets worse	The level of ineptitude with which Theresa May’s desperation bid to entice the unions into supporting her dismal Brexit deal was conducted is a story that needs to be told. The prime minister’s first mistake was to leave TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady off the list of union leaders to call – and the labour movement took note. One union source I spoke to described themselves as staggered that Number 10 could make such a mistake.
JAN11	In a chaotic world young people have little say in, it's no wonder millennials are flocking to Marie Kondo's tidying show	The world can be split into two types of people: those who make their beds every morning after starting the day and people who think nothing of leaving the bed in a crumpled mess before darting out the door. Tidying up is something we’re told, begged and nagged to do from a young age. Yet despite this, after we make our way into the world as adults, it’s an essential life skill that that many of us never quite grasp.
JAN11	We're getting close to a second referendum, and Remain can't risk making the same mistakes again	Today is the start of the new conversation our country desperately needs – one that will urgently confront the political and social crises we are in. Most of us are sick and tired of the apparently endless political infighting, procedural technicalities and mind-numbing ambiguity of Brexit. So I am joining people from all over the country for an emergency Convention today on what really matters now. Parliament has asserted its control of Brexit this week and it feels as though a People’s Vote is within reach. So today is about setting the tone for what lies ahead – and hearing new, hopeful perspectives on what our shared future could be like.
JAN11	Refugees in the Channel are risking everything because of western intervention in the Middle East	A black rubber inflatable boat was found abandoned earlier this week on the shingle at Dungeness on the Kent coast. Eight men, reportedly Iranians or Kurds, were later found close to the beach or in the nearby village of Lydd. An Iranian living in south London was later charged with helping the migrants to cross the Channel illegally from France to the UK.   
JAN11	How paedophile hunters make things worse for the children they want to protect	They present themselves as the X-Men of child exploitation: anonymous, civic-minded vigilantes prepared to go the extra mile to help bring paedophiles to justice. But while paedophile hunters may have some public benefit, this is more than outweighed by the serious legal and moral problems their actions too often pose.
JAN12	The UK has the right to stop the Article 50 process, and the route to a Final Say is clearer than ever	Much has changed since the People’s Vote campaign published the Roadmap to a People’s Vote in September last year. That’s why this week we published an updated edition. As the Brexit clock ticks ever more loudly, the case for a people’s vote has grown stronger in at least four ways. First, the terms of the government’s proposed withdrawal “deal” are now known and have been roundly criticised both by those who voted for Brexit and those who did not. A clear majority of MPs are on record as opposing the deal. And no wonder: despite the wording of Article 50, it provides no clear framework for an eventual permanent relationship with our European neighbours but would, for an indefinite period, leave us stuck in the limbo of obeying EU rules in which we no longer had any say. Facing a heavy defeat, the prime minister chose to deny the Commons their “meaningful vote” in December, but the four wasted weeks since then have not changed the deal. The government is now braced for a heavy defeat on Tuesday evening.
JAN12	Trump’s shutdown tactics should remind health experts they need new tools to thrive in the post-expert era	Donald Trump must be loving the shutdown. Free to roam the White House grounds with barely a soul in sight. Fewer germs to be spread around. For Trump does not like germs; he doesn’t even like health workers who protect people from the spread of germs (“KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE”), and he wants to cut the budget of key agencies that monitor and control germs around the world. He certainly does not want to be working with other states and “s***hole countries” to manage and respond to global health security threats.
JAN12	David Bowie’s cultural mash-ups echoed screenwriter Dennis Potter – and their deaths were strangely aligned too	It is three years since David Bowie died. In that observation, it is not the “three years” that seems odd (though it does, three fleeting years). David Bowie simply doesn’t seem “dead”. And that’s not some banality about his work “living on”, but because the need for him exists and persists.  What is the need for David Bowie? It is the need for originality over novelty. Everyone, on some level, thinks music is somehow not as good now as it was then (it never is, and it always is) – but the point is that we don’t know we need a Bowie (or a Prince or a Leonard Cohen) until such a person happens along. 
JAN12	As the US shutdown enters its fourth week, the president is starting to look for a way out	There is an inevitability about the deadlock in the United States responsible for the longest shutdown of (parts of) federal government. As we wrote when the shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day, had just started, “these things are resolved when the heat of public opinion becomes too great for one side to bear”.  Well, public opinion has not been going Donald Trump’s way. Since mid-December his approval rating has been shifting slightly but steadily against him. The all-important metric is who gets the blame for the impasse. More Americans blamed President Trump for the shutdown than blamed congressional Democrats from the start, but since Christmas the proportion blaming the president has risen from an average of 45 per cent to 49 per cent. 
JAN12	Vaccines do not just protect against diseases. They do much more	A measles vaccine protects against measles infection. By introducing a bit of weakened virus, the immune system learns how to deal with it, so when a real measles virus comes along, it can eliminate it. But does the immune system learn more from the vaccine? Recent research suggests, rather intriguingly, that it does. Our group first noticed this phenomenon in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa over 30 years ago. We followed a large sample of the population, with regular home visits. The focus was on nutritional status, but as a service to the community, in December 1979, we provided a measles vaccine for all children. The following year, we observed something amazing: the measles vaccine reduced overall mortality by more than 70 per cent – much more than could be explained by the prevention of measles infection, which only caused around 10-15 per cent of all deaths at that time.
JAN12	The Top 10: Promises to Leave the Country If a Vote Goes the Wrong Way	In chronological order... 1. Oliver Cromwell. “Probably the earliest and surely the most momentous,” said Ned Holt. He said he would have sold all his property and left England – by implication for the New World – if parliament failed to pass the Grand Remonstrance, addressing the failures of Charles I’s government, in December 1641. 
JAN12	Abuse of Anna Soubry is proof of rising fascist propaganda in post-referendum Britain	There was widespread shock and revulsion at the abuse Anna Soubry received outside her place of work, which happens to be the Houses of Parliament. The irony is that it was the far-right thugs shouting “Nazi’” at her who received less attention. But the bigger picture behind this week’s abhorrent events is far more alarming and should command our attention. Because the UK is witnessing creeping fascism and a revival of destructive nationalism in the wake of the Brexit vote. Back in 1995, Italian historian and novelist Umberto Eco carried out a study into fascism in his country in the 1930s, coming up with 14 signs typical of a far-right regime. What sent a shiver down my back was to see how many of these can already be found in post-referendum Britain.
JAN12	What is Jeremy Hunt doing to secure Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release?	I have just fired off a letter to my MP, Rachael Maskell, York Central, in abject frustration regarding the sorry plight of the political prisoner Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, in order to ask her to raise questions in the House of Commons regarding what the government is doing to secure the release of this young mother. I am becoming increasingly worried and concerned by the government’s lack of action in her case. You could argue that our inept government has its hands tied with the Brexit mess that it has gotten itself into. Unfortunately, this is not good enough. If Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, could spend part of the Christmas recess cultivating trade deals with Singapore and Asia, at the same time as positioning himself as the next Conservative leader, he could have been visibly doing something to secure Nazanin’s release.
JAN12	This awards season, let’s hope the speeches are full of joy, not politics	When Olivia Colman got up on stage to accept her Golden Globe for her performance in The Favourite last Sunday, it was a breath of fresh air. Much has been written about her speech that night already – from her fond address to Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz as her “bitches” to her genuine delight at getting to eat as much as she liked while filming and flying on a private jet to the set. But what struck me most about it, apart from her honesty, was just how refreshingly lighthearted it was.  Her speech struck a totally different note to 2018. Last year’s awards season, following on from the start of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, was more highly charged than usual – and rightly so. 
JAN12	Refugees in the Channel are risking everything because of western intervention in the Middle East	A black rubber inflatable boat was found abandoned earlier this week on the shingle at Dungeness on the Kent coast. Eight men, reportedly Iranians or Kurds, were later found close to the beach or in the nearby village of Lydd. An Iranian living in south London was later charged with helping the migrants to cross the Channel illegally from France to the UK.   
JAN13	If the Tories keep giving young people like me the cold shoulder over Brexit, they’ll lose us for good	The Tories have been out scouring the country looking for youth votes for some time now. Many in the party seem concerned that their current electoral success relies too heavily on the older vote. New schemes, such as the announcement for major tax cuts for university graduates are therefore afoot to lure in younger people. But in my opinion, any attempts to do so will be hopeless as long as this Tory-driven hard Brexit persists.
JAN13	Europe’s far right seems determined to hijack Christianity in its bid for power	An 800-year-old monastery in Italy’s Apennine mountains has become the latest battleground in a bitter war of ideas. The imposing buildings of Trisulti to the east of Rome have been leased by the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a think tank led by Benjamin Harnwell, a British former political aide linked to the US right-wing ideologue Steve Bannon.
JAN13	As the US shutdown enters its fourth week, the president is starting to look for a way out	There is an inevitability about the deadlock in the United States responsible for the longest shutdown of (parts of) federal government. As we wrote when the shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day, had just started, “these things are resolved when the heat of public opinion becomes too great for one side to bear”.  Well, public opinion has not been going Donald Trump’s way.

JAN13	Amber Rudd has done the right thing by not extending the two child benefit cap, but universal credit has failed	When it was launched by Iain Duncan Smith in 2010, a seeming political lifetime ago, universal credit had three main, interconnected, aims, all perfectly laudable. First it was supposed to simplify the complicated and overlapping webs of benefits regimes that had grown up under the welfare state. Second, it was supposed to save the state money in the process – fair to taxpayers and to benefits claimants. Third, the economy as a whole was designed to benefit from the guiding principle that no one should be better off on social security than in work. With tax credits, New Labour and Gordon Brown had implemented some reforms that moved policy in that direction. This was to be a much more ambitious exercise.  It has failed, on all three counts. That much has been known and, from time to time, even acknowledged by ministers for years. Amber Rudd’s radical further reforms to the system represent a more candid and fundamental admission of crisis. She is, she says, seeking to bring a more “compassionate” approach. The arbitrary rules about the child element of benefit after the second child are being abolished; payments will be made to the principal carer, usually the woman, so reducing the abuse of the system by bullying or irresponsible male partners; and she has massively slowed the transfer of claimants into the scheme – a few thousands rather than the 3 million originally scheduled. 
JAN13	Children are getting stabbed to death on our streets – we can do more to tackle these senseless tragedies	There are certain news stories involving the suffering of strangers that hit you hard, and it’s tricky to know where to put those feelings so that you can get on with your day. After all, awful tragedy and cruelty happens every day, all over the world, and to beat your breast and howl every time is impractical. Some, though, stay with me and I long for a rewind button to undo a family’s agony. Lee Pomeroy’s murder soon after Christmas was a horror that I still haven’t been able to get out of my mind.
JAN13	We can’t keep ignoring human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims	A mere week after millions around the globe celebrated the new year and basked in the company of their loved ones, many Uighur Muslim families have had no such luck. They’re falling apart, snatched from each others grips at the hands of Chinese authorities. And for those who have family members who have yet to be sent away to camps, maintaining contact is as risky as ever. I used to live in Xinjiang (also known as East Turkestan), and fled with my family once the authorities escalated their cruel tactics against my community. But we’re still hearing countless stories about relentless arrests from relatives and old friends. 
JAN13	One veteran Labour MP’s view on Brexit gives a clue as to how the rest of the party will follow	Jim Fitzpatrick has been a Labour MP for 21 years, being first elected in the new dawn of 1997. He was a firefighter before he became an MP. He served as a government whip and a minister for most of the New Labour years.  Like most Labour MPs he is out of tune with the Jeremy Corbyn party, but he is no Blairite. He resigned from the Labour front bench in protest against Ed Miliband’s refusal to rule out support for punitive strikes on the Assad regime in Syria for its use of chemical weapons. “I am opposed to military intervention in Syria, full stop,” he said.
JAN13	Corbyn could destroy the government’s authority over Brexit – but only if he stopped ignoring Labour’s wishes	To borrow a phrase, Jeremy Corbyn is not a stupid man. He is sincere in his socialist beliefs and his patriotism. He wants what is best for the country, just as his opponents in the government do. Trouble is, he has even less of a plan than they do. Around 10 weeks away from putative Brexit day, Mr Corbyn is either being excessively cagey about his true intentions or he doesn’t know what to do. Perhaps for that reason, and to camouflage the lack of policy, he projects some sort of enigmatic guru vibe in his public statements, as when questioned on The Andrew Marr Show today.
JAN13	Chris Grayling is right that blocking Brexit will lead to more far-right extremism – but that doesn’t mean it shouldn't happen	Chris Grayling is right. But before you wonder if I’ve taken leave of my senses, I should add that it’s only in connection with his view that there will be a disturbing right-wing reaction if Britain makes a move towards a people’s vote.   Having spent three hours on the streets of Devizes, Wiltshire, on Saturday helping to run a stall for our local People’s Vote campaign and finding plenty of support, it was also clear that many Leave supporters are hardening their views.  
JAN14	Remarkably, Theresa May is still blatantly ignoring the urgency of the Brexit deadline – here's why	Parliament has taken back control of the Brexit process and some don’t like it. The Sunday Times front page carried the headline “A Very British Coup” with a piece that claimed there is a cross-party backbench “plot”. The truth is that the UK’s legislature has historically, more often than not, been the executive’s poodle. But no longer – this is not a coup, it is parliamentary democracy in action and it’s about time too.  Our job as legislators is not to rubber-stamp whatever the government wants, quite the opposite. We are determined to ensure the House of Commons does not have to dance to the tune of ministers who want to run down the clock and blackmail MPs into voting for the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future trading relationship with the EU, which her own economic impact assessments tell us will make our country poorer.
JAN14	White feminism's failings handed Megyn Kelly a $69m payout after she was fired for racism	Once one of America’s most sought-after hosts, Megyn Kelly – along with her former network, NBC – has today come under heavy fire for accepting a $69 million pay-out after she was fired for comments defending the use of blackface. The astronomical settlement has, quite rightly, faced widespread criticism. It seems like an incredibly unfair turn of events, but it’s also an important opportunity to take a moment and consider the forces at play that got us to this point. In a blind desire to transform Kelly into an unrequited liberal feminist icon, it was the denial of her reactionary and often racist views that gave rise to her power. As a white person and a feminist, I’m ashamed of how still in 2019 true intersectionality seems as far from reach as it ever was.
JAN14	The Weeknd’s lyrics were homophobic – who cares if it's ‘sensitive’ to point that out?	In the last few days, R&B artist The Weeknd has been criticised on social media for his lyrics in a new track released with French DJ Gesaffelstein called “Lost in the Fire”. In the song, the artist refers to a woman’s same-sex attraction as “a phase” and promises to “f**k you straight”.  When queer musician Marika Hackman called this out on Twitter, writing, “Well done to @theweeknd for managing to deride, fetishise and dismiss lesbianism all in one verse”, many commentators, whose own “sensitivity” to this very valid criticism was clearly lost on them, attacked Hackman for being – you guessed it – “oversensitive”. Scrolling through the comments revealed the predictable abuse any woman on social media has come to expect, but the volume of comments dismissing her as being “too sensitive” or of “reaching” were telling. 
JAN14	Jeremy Corbyn, I represent our party in the European Parliament – please do what’s right for our constituents	Since Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader he has promised to make the Labour Party more democratic and give power back to the grassroots. That is one of the reasons why I supported his campaign twice: I believed in a different way of doing politics. He has begun to deliver on that promise by instigating the Democracy Review. But there is more work to do if members are to feel they are truly being listened to. Seventy-five per cent of Labour members now back giving the people a Final Say on the Brexit deal, and if Jeremy is to fulfil his promise to the membership then backing that should be Labour policy. Otherwise, he risks losing the faith of those who championed him against all odds.
JAN14	Have we been misled over the importance of government debt?	“Fiscal illusion” sounds like the kind of thing Derren Brown might do to your wallet in front of a packed theatre. But actually, fiscal illusions are what perturb experts at places such as the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
JAN14	As the US shutdown enters its fourth week, the president is starting to look for a way out	There is an inevitability about the deadlock in the United States responsible for the longest shutdown of (parts of) federal government. As we wrote when the shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day, had just started, “these things are resolved when the heat of public opinion becomes too great for one side to bear”.  Well, public opinion has not been going Donald Trump’s way. Since mid-December his approval rating has been shifting slightly but steadily against him. The all-important metric is who gets the blame for the impasse. More Americans blamed President Trump for the shutdown than blamed congressional Democrats from the start, but since Christmas the proportion blaming the president has risen from an average of 45 per cent to 49 per cent. 
JAN14	Trump is rattling sabres over Iran while quietly echoing the Obama playbook	Donald Trump wants you to think he is pressuring Iran with an iron fist.  His secretary of state Mike Pompeo sounded bullish when he announced in Cairo last week that the goal was to expel “every last Iranian boot” from Syria, crushing the Iranian power that emerged from President Barack Obama’s “dire misjudgements”. 
JAN14	Without divine intervention, it looks like Theresa May’s deal is finished	Rarely has a government approached the House of Commons for a positive “meaningful vote” on a vital piece of its programme with so little expectation of success. The daughter of a vicar, Theresa May must be hoping for some sort of divine intervention to assist her supposedly landmark agreement between the UK and the EU gaining parliamentary assent. The only question is the scale of the humiliation that will be heaped upon her. All things considered, it would be best if this deal was buried beyond hope of resurrection. The thunderbolts from heaven aimed at Bernard Jenkin, Dominic Raab, Mark Francois and other media-friendly apostates have not yet struck. They have their own tablets of truth. The opposition to her deal stretches widely across the Commons and she hasn’t had much luck in changing many minds.
JAN14	Dear Jeremy Corbyn, public opinion is shifting – support a Final Say and end the Brexit deadlock	With the risk of a catastrophic Brexit less than 80 days away, we believe it is time for the Labour Party to support a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. Over the last two and a half years, we have learned of the negative impacts Brexit will have on the lives of our constituents.
JAN14	Businesses employ due diligence when making major decisions – why can’t we do the same with Brexit?	When a company is considering making a major acquisition, it goes through a process of due diligence. This is to get more clarity about what it is buying and ensuring there are no hidden bombshells. It will reserve the right to modify its offer or withdraw from the transaction based on what it finds during the due diligence process.
JAN15	How Theresa May’s Brexit deal was killed off by her own incompetence	After the sun sets in Westminster, MPs filed through parliament’s division lobbies and voted down Theresa May’s proposed deal with the European Union. It has become conventional wisdom to imagine that this situation was inevitable – that the contradictions inherent within Brexit caused it to collapse under the strain of its impossible promises. But this calamity was not destiny: it has, in fact, mark one of the gravest failures of statecraft since the creation of the British state in 1707. May’s premiership has been characterised by almost unprecedented errors of diplomacy, negotiating strategy with the EU, governing style and domestic political strategy at home.  In the immediate aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave, there was a profound feeling of shock, sorrow and regret among European leaders. There was a determination to limit the damage to the unification project and a desire to keep Britain close. Before long the mood began to change: European capitals were aghast at the appointment of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary, a role that he was manifestly ill-suited for. He quickly launched a British diplomatic effort to divide and conquer European capitals in the summer of 2016 – seeking to identify and play to narrow national interests – but it failed and only served to further damage trust.
JAN15	Remarkably, Theresa May is still blatantly ignoring the urgency of the Brexit deadline – here's why	Parliament has taken back control of the Brexit process and some don’t like it.

JAN15	Cleopatra should be played by a black actor – but not just because it might be more historically accurate	The Daily Star has revealed that Lady Gaga and Angelina Jolie are competing for the title role in Sony’s upcoming, big-budget production of Cleopatra. After the internet collectively groaned at yet another Cleopatra remake, a “whitewashing” debate began to emerge. Should Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie, both white actors, be playing the Egyptian queen in the first place?
JAN15	The Weeknd’s lyrics were homophobic – who cares if it's ‘sensitive’ to point that out?	In the last few days, R&B artist The Weeknd has been criticised on social media for his lyrics in a new track released with French DJ Gesaffelstein called “Lost in the Fire”.

JAN15	Could I have done more to prevent Brexit?	We all have moments when we wonder what might have been. What if we’d accepted a different job offer; what if a young relationship hadn’t ended prematurely; what if we’d said “yes” instead of “no” (or vice versa)? It is often remarked that the argument over the UK’s membership of the EU had been lost long before the referendum in 2016, suspicion of the union having been carefully fomented in the crucible of the tabloid press over many years. Brexit was long in the making.
JAN15	The celebrated new Gillette ad proves even MeToo can be co-opted by the male-dominated capitalist machine	I never thought I’d see a day where it was me arguing that “MeToo has gone too far”, yet here we are. Like all good things, a movement created to empower women has been co-opted by the male-dominated capitalist machine and butchered into a one-and-a-half minute ad to make men feel better about themselves (and buy stuff, of course). This week Gillette, one of the best known men’s razor brands, has released an ad which overlays news snippets about the MeToo movement with examples of sexism: a bad sitcom where a man appears to grope a woman, a music video with provocative female dancers in varying states of undress, a man speaking over a woman in a board meeting. The implication being that this kind of behaviour is in the past – in this post-MeToo world (whatever that means), we’re better than this.
JAN15	Brexit has turned into the British exit from civilised debate – the sooner we do away with it, the better	There’s been a great deal of debate about precisely what it is that Brexit means, but it seems that it is now finally becoming clear: Brexit means the British exit from the world stage – making ourselves into a global irrelevance. From the scenes on our streets and in parliament, Brexit also appears to mean the British exit from civilised debate.
JAN15	Despite the views of the right-wing press, the British people still want a Final Say on Brexit	Judging by the polling evidence, a small but consistent majority of people favour a second referendum to resolve the current crisis over Britain’s relationship with Europe. The divergence between this and the house views of most traditional media outlets is quite striking. Of the national titles, only The Independent has given its unequivocal support to such an outcome, although The Guardian has come close with its call for “people’s assemblies” that it admitted could very well lead to a fresh poll. The remainder have either backed May’s deal, with more or less tepidity, or a no deal – with the exception of the Daily Mirror, which is in tune with the Labour leadership’s desire for a general election that probably won’t resolve anything and, as things stand, is unlikely to happen. 
JAN15	A no-deal Brexit could destroy London’s thriving economy – Theresa May should rule it out now	Businesses across our city have been clear: a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster. From the retailers and construction companies who have been forced to re-plan and re-jig their supply chains, to the professional services firms reviewing thousands of contracts, they agree that no amount of last-minute contingency planning will be able to prevent the damage caused by crashing out of the EU at the end of March.   That’s why we – London business and London government – are joining together to call on all MPs from across all parties and constituencies to protect jobs, prosperity and living standards first and to take a no-deal Brexit off the table.
JAN16	Does Corbyn’s failure to secure a general election mean he will now support a Final Say referendum?	Jeremy Corbyn’s heart wasn’t in it. I’m sure he would love to fight another general election campaign, but he was not very good at pretending he thought it was likely.  At prime minister’s questions, before the debate on the no-confidence motion, he asked: “With poverty rising, can the prime minister tell us when we can expect it to fall?” As he said it, he seemed to realise this implied she would be in charge for a while, so he added: “... for the time that she remains in office?” 
JAN16	China’s biggest fall in exports in two years is bad news for all of us – and this is why	The place to watch if you want to know what is going on with the world economy is not so much America, but China. We are not used to this. In the past, the big swings in economic growth have started in the US, and of course it still massively important. But right now China is more volatile.
JAN16	Theresa May can’t be trusted with Brexit – but Jeremy Corbyn needs to start acting like part of the solution	Her Majesty’s government enjoys the confidence of the House of Commons. It certainly doesn’t seem to be enjoying very much else. Something profound has overcome British parliamentary politics in recent weeks. The government has, very gradually, lost control of its European policy. Though dramatic, the historic defeat on the prime minister’s deal merely drew attention to the fact. 
JAN16	Boohoo's sales growth says heaps about our environmental priorities – but avoiding fast fashion is easier than you think	In a month over-saturated with virtue signalling, from Veganuary displays to #ecoresolutions pledges, why aren’t we challenging how we consume fashion? We may have banned straws, but fast fashion is still growing as an industry and we don't seem to care. How long can this continue?
JAN16	How can we tackle this Brexit mess? Give the north of England more money	With Brexit dominating the headlines, the pressing issue facing local leaders like myself is how to prepare our communities for the challenges that we may face over the coming months and years. But for too long politicians have failed to address the lack of investment in the north. With Britain’s imminent departure from the European Union, this is something that we can no longer stand for. I met with the chancellor last week to press him on the importance of renewed and fair investment in the north of England. Much of our predicament is a consequence of the historic legacies of deindustrialisation and the concentration of economic and political power in London and the southeast. This continues to leave its lasting mark on many communities: long term unemployment, a lack of well-paid jobs, boarded up shops and empty town centres are an all too familiar sight in many of Britain's towns and cities.
JAN16	As the US shutdown enters its fourth week, the president is starting to look for a way out	There is an inevitability about the deadlock in the United States responsible for the longest shutdown of (parts of) federal government. As we wrote when the shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day, had just started, “these things are resolved when the heat of public opinion becomes too great for one side to bear”.  Well, public opinion has not been going Donald Trump’s way. Since mid-December his approval rating has been shifting slightly but steadily against him. The all-important metric is who gets the blame for the impasse. More Americans blamed President Trump for the shutdown than blamed congressional Democrats from the start, but since Christmas the proportion blaming the president has risen from an average of 45 per cent to 49 per cent. 
JAN16	Why the new upskirting law can't stop tech-savvy abusers	Upskirting is to become a criminal offence in England and Wales, punishable by up to two years in prison, and it’s about time.  It is a resounding success for an 18-month campaign by activist Gina Martin. She began the fight for legislation after being upskirted at a music festival, only to be told that police could not deal with it as it wasn’t a specific offence. 
JAN16	Just like the Suez crisis, Brexit humiliation is a stark reminder of Britain’s waning global influence	Rarely, a moment arrives in a nation’s history when reality hits, and it realises that it is not the power it was, not the force it fancies itself to be, and that it cannot get what it wants because other, stronger nations, won’t allow it to. It is becoming more obvious that Brexit is just such a moment for the UK. As Theresa May asks us to consider what the historians will say, it is a nice moment to suggest that they shouldn’t heap the blame on her. She made her mistakes, heaven knows, but the fundamental problem for her is that the EU is, roughly, ten times bigger than the UK. In population, in economic heft, in terms of the scale it can bring to its negotiations with other economic superpowers such as the US, China, India and Japan.
JAN16	Brexit is the mess of all messes, with no clear route out	Whatever the outcome of the political machinations of the next few weeks, the nation has got itself into a catch-22 situation where it just can’t win. Let us start with the not unreasonable hypothesis that Brexit was as much a protest about austerity, as it was about immigration levels. With rising wages, flourishing local communities and economies and a well-ordered welfare system, it is doubtful that Brexit would have received nearly as much support. Brexit was a vote of no confidence in the political classes and their ability to listen to the nation’s woes.
JAN16	May’s defeat reveals the brutal reality of Brexit – let's revoke Article 50 and take time to decide our next step	Theresa May was right about one thing, her startling Brexit defeat has settled nothing, and made our future, if anything, more murky than before. So then, where do we go from here? Labour seems fated to lose its no confidence motion this evening; the government will remain in place. Theresa May appears determined not to extend Article 50; absent action we will leave with no deal at the end of March. There is no majority anywhere for that ruinous outcome.
JAN17	Enough of Brexit bunker mentality – it is time our Conservative Party backed a Final Say	Politics is full of military and often masculine metaphors, so we hesitate to use such an image to convey what a small, sober group of us are trying to achieve at the moment. But essentially, today we broke cover and went over the top on behalf of our party. Given recent history, arguing the Conservative case for remaining in Europe was never going to be easy. Questioning the wisdom of proceeding with Brexit at this late stage incurs instant wrath, but regardless, some of us have dared to do so in an attempt to show it is in fact beautifully safe on the other side. 
JAN17	Netanyahu's chilling '10 year challenge' post says so much about the future of Israel	Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have seen that the “10 year challenge” has swept the internet this week. Social media users have been busy sharing flashback pictures of themselves with more hair, worse skin and horrific wardrobes to show how far they’ve come. A lot has changed in the last decade; that much is clear. In 2009, most of us were too busy discovering Lady Gaga and Twitter to worry about whether the host of The Apprentice would become president of the United States.
JAN17	What it’s like to suffer from haemochromatosis, the Celtic disease which is more common than you think	It was the summer of 1987. I had just returned from a two year stint in Saudi Arabia with my family and I had a three-year-old toddler who was like Speedy Gonzales, constantly on the move. I had been feeling very tired for months, but I put it down to living in intense heat and having an active child.  Then my sister got diagnosed with a rare disease called hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). As you can probably guess by the name, it’s a genetic illness – and when she was told by her doctors that she had it, she was also advised to tell all of her other siblings to get tested. Each of us had a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the same condition – and I won the medal.
JAN17	We should be very worried at the news that Wales locks up the most people in western Europe	For those of us who have had the luxury of not coming into direct contact with the criminal justice system, the idea that prison is largely rehabilitative carries a lot of weight. Buying into the binary tale of good versus evil, we can believe that criminal behaviour is Britain punished justly and proportionately, with life-changing lessons learned as a result of the considered support that prison offers offenders. But it’s not always that straightforward. In fact, it rarely is – especially when it comes to the most marginalised groups such as women, foreign nationals, trafficked persons and BME offenders. And if you happen to belong to all of the above groups, the likelihood of having “gained” anything beyond an increased chance of reoffending is low.
JAN17	As the US shutdown enters its fourth week, the president is starting to look for a way out	There is an inevitability about the deadlock in the United States responsible for the longest shutdown of (parts of) federal government. As we wrote when the shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day, had just started, “these things are resolved when the heat of public opinion becomes too great for one side to bear”.  Well, public opinion has not been going Donald Trump’s way. Since mid-December his approval rating has been shifting slightly but steadily against him. The all-important metric is who gets the blame for the impasse. More Americans blamed President Trump for the shutdown than blamed congressional Democrats from the start, but since Christmas the proportion blaming the president has risen from an average of 45 per cent to 49 per cent. 
JAN17	Boohoo's sales growth says heaps about our environmental priorities – but avoiding fast fashion is easier than you think	In a month over-saturated with virtue signalling, from Veganuary displays to #ecoresolutions pledges, why aren’t we challenging how we consume fashion? We may have banned straws, but fast fashion is still growing as an industry and we don't seem to care. How long can this continue?
JAN17	Forget talking to the PM about her historic Brexit defeat – Corbyn must listen to Labour members now	Consensus! Cuddles! That’s what we need now. But Jeremy Corbyn is being a big meany and won’t join in the parliamentary group hug. Much has been made of the prime minister’s offer of meetings with “senior parliamentarians” to supposedly discuss “a way forward” and find “consensus” after her dismal Brexit deal was the subject of an historic House of Commons defeat for a governing party.
JAN17	Bernie Sanders could be US president in 2020 – and this is what it means for Israel and the Middle East	If you’re an American, he’s still out there among the “maybe” candidates. But if you live in the Middle East – whether you’re Arab or Israeli, Muslim, Jew or Christian – you should keep your eye on Bernie Sanders. He’s no shoo-in, of course – certainly not after his pitiful handover to the awful Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. I still remember shouting “No!” myself when I heard his fans cursing his decision to stand down in favour of Clinton. But the guy just might have the guts, even the courage, to stand up to the ally to whom the US always gives groveling, uncritical, slavish, immoral support.
JAN17	Theresa May could easily rule out no-deal Brexit. She won’t – she needs the threat of chaos to survive	Following the crushing of Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the House of Commons and the same MPs’ decision to confirm her government in office, few would dispute that British politics is at an impasse. In a desperate attempt to find a way forward, May offered Jeremy Corbyn the prospect of immediate talks on a cross-party Brexit consensus. Corbyn’s response was to rule out talks unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.
JAN17	Jess Varnish’s treatment in the British Cycling gig economy should make us reconsider our taste for tarnished glory	Jess Varnish may have lost the chance to sue British Cycling and UK Sport for wrongful dismissal and sexual discrimination after a ruling last night, but the former track sprinter has at least rattled the cage of a medal-hungry machine, and reminded us about the price paid for the new realities of sporting and working life. A judgement on Wednesday found that Varnish was not an employee or a worker of either of the aforementioned organisations. It leaves her unable to pursue her case for discrimination, and leaves us without the chance to understand what really went on.
JAN18	Ignorant wishful thinking has harmed our approach to Brexit – much as it did during the Arab Spring	In the Arab Spring of 2011 much of the foreign media covering the protests in Egypt gathered in or around Tahrir Square in Cairo to report the daily confrontations between demonstrators demanding the overthrow of the regime and security forces seeking to preserve it.  The scene in Tahrir was the backdrop to countless television interviews with opposition activists and what happened there was portrayed as a barometer which would tell the world if the Egyptian revolution would succeed or fail. When President Hosni Mubarak resigned on 11 February many television viewers and newspaper readers got the impression that the revolutionaries had won and Egypt was entering an era of freedom and democracy.
JAN18	If Trump really did tell Cohen to lie to congress, impeachment will be the least of his problems	The tenets of the Moscow rules include “everything can potentially be under opposition control”, “always keep your options open” and “do not openly harass your adversaries”. Donald Trump is now discovering how the strategic tradecraft of western intelligence agencies in the Cold War is going to impact on the Russiagate inquiry. The latest allegations regarding whether the US president was the Muscovian candidate for the White House are particularly damning even in the context of the stream of highly damaging material which has been emerging in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
JAN18	Michael Cohen’s revelations may prove uncomfortable for Trump – but he will remain safe from impeachment	For a man once described as Donald Trump’s “fixer”, Michael Cohen is doing quite an effective job in fixing his old boss. The “pitbull” lawyer has turned on Trump. Few business tycoons are able to keep many secrets from their lawyers, and it seems that Mr Cohen is singing like a canary in an old film noir to the FBI about his time as the president’s personal counsel. Having been convicted of lying to congress about some putative plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow – and sent to jail for three years – it is now reported that Mr Cohen is telling anyone who will listen – including the Mueller probe – that Mr Trump himself instructed him to lie to congress about the scheme. It has prompted further calls for the impeachment of the president, and the grounds would seem to qualify for the kind of high crime and misdemeanour envisaged in the US Constitution, and thus be sufficient for congress to initiate proceedings. Indeed, during his confirmation hearing with the Senate, William Barr, Mr Trump’s nominee for the new attorney general, said explicitly that a president “convincing a witness to change testimony” would be obstruction of justice. 
JAN18	John Bercow is an upstanding member of parliament – he deserves a peerage	Even in this era of very low political standards I shall be very disappointed if reports that John Bercow has been blocked from a peerage are indeed correct. Surely, this is none other than an attack of pique and an attempt to punish the speaker purely for doing his job in a robust manner. Other politicians are presently forgetting their principles to either further their careers or avoid brow-beating from their party’s executive. Whereas the current speaker is clearly not open to pressure from anyone and his tenacity in standing up for protocol and common sense at the same time are to be loudly applauded.
JAN18	Mea Culpa: listen to reason, pivot, swivel and U-turn	In politics, “pivot” is one of those irregular conjugations that goes something like: I listen to reason, you pivot, he/she/it swivels, they U-turn. It is enjoying a vogue in discussion of Brexit, as people suggest that Theresa May might “pivot” to a softer Brexit or that Jeremy Corbyn might “pivot” to a new referendum.  I know language changes and all that, but I think we should avoid the word in our reporting, because – despite conjuring visions of the sofa-moving scene in Friends – it implies a deft switch to a better position. 
JAN18	What it’s like to suffer from haemochromatosis, the Celtic disease which is more common than you think	It was the summer of 1987. I had just returned from a two year stint in Saudi Arabia with my family and I had a three-year-old toddler who was like Speedy Gonzales, constantly on the move. I had been feeling very tired for months, but I put it down to living in intense heat and having an active child.  Then my sister got diagnosed with a rare disease called hereditary haemochromatosis (HH).

Each of us had a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the same condition – and I won the medal.
JAN18	While the government focuses on cleaning up its Brexit mess, these are the issues being ignored	Well, what a week it has been in parliament! Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence only 24 hours after her government suffered the biggest defeat in history, watching as its flagship policy withered on the floor of the House of Commons. Our country’s future is at stake. The decisions the government and parliament take in the coming weeks will not only determine our relationship with our closest neighbours, but also who we want to be as a country and as a people.
JAN18	In 38 years working in Westminster, I've never seen it this bad – backbenchers are right to try to seize control	“You are not children in the playground, you are legislators,” boomed Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, before the naughty kids rejected Theresa May’s Brexit deal by 230 votes. Yet it is the leadership of both main parties that are acting like children. May and Jeremy Corbyn can’t even agree on whether to meet. The prime minister left the opposition leader off her guest list when she invited “senior parliamentarians” for talks aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock. When she belatedly included him, Corbyn refused to attend unless she first took a no-deal exit off the table. Both leaders were wrong to set preconditions.
JAN18	Trump second anniversary: If you thought the first two years were crazy, then you’d better buckle up	A year later, there has been no official word on how Trump will mark the occasion, if at all. Holed up inside the White House as the partial government shutdown approaches its fifth week, the president may decide to keep things low key. One thing we can be sure of is that as Trump embarks on the second half of his term – he was inaugurated at noon EST on 20 January 2017 in a ceremony in which he delivered a bellicose address vowing to end “this American carnage” – it will be anything but low key.
JAN18	Prince Philip has every right to drive at 97 – he didn't even do a runner, so what's the big deal?	I suppose the first question that comes to mind about Prince Philip’s audition to be the new Top Gear Stig is: “What was he doing driving himself anyway?” One of the many benefits of being one of them royals is that you get driven round everywhere. You can get as sloshed as you like in your bib ’n’ tucker entertaining the Portuguese President or the King of Thailand, and the chauffeurs will get you home just fine. Who needs Uber?
JAN19	The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgrace – since Dimbleby left it’s turning into a political version of Jeremy Kyle	Over a long political career I have appeared on BBC Question Time innumerable times, but I have never had such a horrible experience as I had in Derby last week.  I am not a “snowflake” on these matters. Most of my appearances have been with David Dimbleby as chair. Dimbleby could never be mistaken for a socialist. He ruled the programme with an iron hand and was capable of some very sharp interventions indeed. But he had a huge depth of knowledge about politics and tried to treat each panellist fairly. 
JAN19	The Taliban has failed to recapture Afghanistan after 17 years of war – and this is why	The Taliban has refused peace talks for years, hoping that one day it will capture Kabul, remove a democratic government, and form an extreme regime in the country as they did in 1996. But Afghanistan is stronger today than it was back then: at that time the institutions were entirely destroyed during the civil war and there was no army. But now they are functional, with 314,000 Afghan army and police as well as 22,000 foreign troops. The Taliban is still able to conduct high-profile attacks in Kabul and capture some parts of other cities. But it cannot be kept in one area of the city for long while ordinary people as well as its own members are being affected.
JAN19	I won’t be joining today's Women’s March – and this is why	  It was heartbreaking when a year into the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, after all the marches, the street protests and the chants, some of those same women who bravely shared their powerful stories with the world said they felt like no real changes had been made.  As a result though, the Women’s March was the biggest single-day protest in US history. It boosted morale, spreading important messages and saw countless inspiring bystanders. I’ve been a part of many women’s marches myself – whether it was campaigning against everyday sexism, fighting for gender equality in all its forms, or getting behind the women of MeToo. Today, there will be another series of marches, but I feel they have served their purpose for a time, and now it’s time to start talking. The marches can and have only taken us so far. 
JAN19	The tribalism in our society may be what is holding it together	The tribalism that Patrick Gilbert has referred to in his article is what I myself have been afraid we may descend into, due to the painfully divisive actions of this government. It seems the prime minister now is basically a hopeless pied piper leading us deep into the mountain, apparently hell-bent on self-destruction. The word “tribalism” suggests in a lot of people’s minds a step backward from civilisation. Certainly, I think, that was the sense in which the Queen meant it in her speech at Christmas.
JAN19	Far from a ‘coup’, this democratic step could give the people a Final Say on Brexit	If in the end parliament decides to allow the British people the final say on Brexit in a new referendum, Sir Keir Starmer, Yvette Cooper and Dominic Grieve will be leading names among those who should be praised for doing their democratic duty.  Sir Keir has fought tenaciously to keep the leader of the Labour Party from closing off the option of another referendum, which is overwhelmingly supported by its members. Today the shadow Brexit secretary kept up the pressure by saying, in a speech to the Fabian Society, that, if the party could not force a general election, there were only “two remaining options”. 
JAN19	Most of us will never change our minds about Brexit no matter what happens – our brains simply can't	The human brain, like every other brain on this planet, evolved to do certain things – to survive and reproduce.  Sitting within us are a lot of basic motivational systems. We are motivated to be alert to threats and to take defensive action. That’s what gives us the basis to be anxious, aggressive, and depressed. But we are also motivated to form caring attachments to kin and friends, to be compassionate to those we know and even in certain contexts those we don’t. Tragically though, the history of human slavery, wars and atrocities shows that leaders and politicians often stimulate our threat-focused, aggressive and nastier traits while suppressing our compassionate sides. 
JAN19	In a bizarre turn of events, Theresa May could get her Brexit deal through after all – the key lies with Yvette Cooper	Yvette Cooper is in many ways the alternative leader of the opposition. The Labour MP who chairs the Home Affairs Committee will table a bill in the House of Commons on Monday, under the catchy title of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 3) Bill, which could be decisive in breaking the Brexit deadlock.  It could lead to parliament being forced to make a straight choice between Theresa May’s deal and postponing Brexit in order to hold a new referendum. If that is what happens, I think there would be a small majority for the prime minister’s deal. 
JAN19	Don't be fooled by Corbyn's ‘no deal off the table’ demands – he knows May is powerless to concede	Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that, unlike the other party leaders, he won’t accept Theresa May’s invitation to private talks to try to find a consensus way forward, not until she agrees to “take no deal off the table”. This move purports to paint Corbyn as the responsible agent in the negotiations, insisting that the prime minister put an end to the damaging effects on confidence associated with the fear of a no-deal Brexit.
JAN19	Don't tell me ‘toxic masculinity’ isn't real – it could have cost me my life	Thanks to that damned Gillette ad everyone’s suddenly talking about toxic masculinity, and it seems to have given a tanker full of oxygen to the freaks who help to make it so toxic in the first place. You know who I’m talking about: Piers Morgan, Fox News anchors, people who use phrases like ‘man up’ ‘snowflake’, and ‘stiff upper lip’. Tossers, in other words.   It’s in part because of the climate we’ve allowed them to create, or perhaps to police because it’s always been around, that when I called to warn one of my editors about why I’d be filing late the other week I couldn’t tell them exactly why. 
JAN19	Trump second anniversary: If you thought the first two years were crazy, then you’d better buckle up	A year later, there has been no official word on how Trump will mark the occasion, if at all. Holed up inside the White House as the partial government shutdown approaches its fifth week, the president may decide to keep things low key. One thing we can be sure of is that as Trump embarks on the second half of his term – he was inaugurated at noon EST on 20 January 2017 in a ceremony in which he delivered a bellicose address vowing to end “this American carnage” – it will be anything but low key.
JAN20	The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgrace – since Dimbleby left it’s turning into a political version of Jeremy Kyle	Over a long political career I have appeared on BBC Question Time innumerable times, but I have never had such a horrible experience as I had in Derby last week.  I am not a “snowflake” on these matters. Most of my appearances have been with David Dimbleby as chair. Dimbleby could never be mistaken for a socialist.

JAN20	Yes, the new Mary Queen of Scots film is inaccurate – but don't worry, historians can't agree on her anyway	The story of Mary Queen of Scots, packed as it is with drama and tragedy, has always been a favourite of film makers. As far back as 1895, Thomas Edison made The Execution of Mary Stuart, a short film which was the first ever to use special effects to show Mary having her head chopped off. Since then, the doomed Scottish queen has been the subject of numerous biopics, from Katharine Hepburn’s Mary of Scotland (1936) to the new Josie Rourke film Mary Queen of Scots, starring Saoirse Ronan as Mary. When newspapers and magazines cover period dramas, historians are always asked if they are accurate. As far as the new Rourke film is concerned, the answer is no, of course not.
JAN20	Davos can still be a force for meaningful change, even if the global elite aren’t	Davos is here again this week. The small mountain town in Switzerland, a health spa before it became a ski resort, is host once again to the annual meeting of the global elite – the industrialists, politicians and other leaders who run the world economy – at the World Economic Forum. Figures like these have been dubbed “Davos man” by the American political scientist Samuel P Huntington, who in 2004 wrote a paper about “an emerging global superclass”.
JAN20	The Taliban has failed to recapture Afghanistan after 17 years of war – and this is why	The Taliban has refused peace talks for years, hoping that one day it will capture Kabul, remove a democratic government, and form an extreme regime in the country as they did in 1996.

JAN20	The success of yellow vest protesters in France hinges on their whiteness – and this is why	The Clash’s song “White Riot” would be a fitting musical accompaniment to the on-going yellow vests insurrection against French president Emmanuel Macron’s government. During weeks of disturbances, there has barely been a brown or black face in sight. This absence is particularly notable in major cities such as Paris, where vast suburban communities habitually blamed for all social ills have shown next to no interest in joining.
JAN20	Italy’s far-right movement has never been stronger – this year’s European elections will prove that	Matteo Salvini’s League and Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement have already embarked in their European electoral campaign tours, readying the ground for the most important and pivotal ones so far. Because of Brexit, the number of MEPs will change; of the 73 UK seats, 46 will be freed up and available for possible EU enlargements, while 27 will be shared out among underrepresented EU countries, so Italian seats will increase from 73 to 76.
JAN20	I want Brexit to tear the main parties apart – at least we’d have a shot at a fairer voting system	Perhaps I’m just a starry-eyed optimist, but I’m starting to hope that the silver lining of the potential Brexit calamity is that both of the largest parties could tear themselves apart. That could leave us with a parliament of several parties of former Labour and Conservative members, and a few more, Lib Dems, Greens and others.
JAN20	This is what it feels like to have your image used to promote a body shaming photo editing app	Imagine scrolling through your Facebook, Instagram or Twitter feed and coming across a picture or video of yourself in a sponsored post of a company you've never heard of. In my case, it wasn’t a picture of me smiling for a dating site or even promoting a classy pair of sunglasses for half the price. No such luck. I recently came across an ad and saw myself on one of those “body-changing apps” that can magically photoshop away love handles, slim down faces, or give you six-pack abs with the swipe of a finger. What’s worse, I had not given permission to be used in these ads nor had I received payment.
JAN21	MLK should be remembered as a revolutionary thinker – not a sanitised figure for conservatives like Mike Pence to exploit	 21 January is dedicated, for the 34th time, to the celebration of Martin Luther King Jr Day in the United States, and this year is particularly special as January 2019 marks 90 years since the activist’s birth.
JAN21	The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgrace – since Dimbleby left it’s turning into a political version of Jeremy Kyle	Over a long political career I have appeared on BBC Question Time innumerable times, but I have never had such a horrible experience as I had in Derby last week.

JAN21	Theresa May is wrong to claim there's no time for a people’s vote – here’s how we can easily make it happen within months	In politics the constraints of time all too often override the considerations of principle and practicality. That is where we are this week: the prime minister is desperately trying to delay firm decision-making by MPs, in the hope that they will be forced to accept that her bad deal is less disastrous than a crash-out no deal. Ministers are also seeking to head off the increasingly strident, cross-party backing of the Liberal Democrat call for a people’s vote – where the public are given the chance to weigh up the government’s Brexit option against the advantages of staying in the EU on current terms. This is being fought with claims by the government that “there isn’t time”. Their back-of-an-envelope estimate, with no supporting evidence, is that the legislation and campaign would take 12 months.
JAN21	As an MEP I know Europe’s problems are caused by bad leadership – here’s how we can solve Brexit and the refugee crisis	Everything about Brexit has been a disaster – from the long and winding road leading to the 2016 referendum, to the chaos and ongoing resignation of ministers and the British parliament’s vote on the exit deal negotiated with the EU 27. Every step of the way there has been turmoil and a lack of vision and responsibility. It all comes down to one thing: failure in leadership. It is young Brits who will have to live with the choices made on their behalf. They voted in vast majority to Remain, but their voice wasn’t heard. That is not leadership. The political leaders of today have to stand accountable to the generations of tomorrow, who will live with the consequences of what we do – or more importantly, what we fail to do.
JAN21	Davos can still be a force for meaningful change, even if the global elite aren’t	Davos is here again this week.

JAN21	Hard borders are directly to blame for the deaths of 170 migrants at sea – and European leaders know it	On 14 October 1914, 16,000 Belgian refugees arrived in Folkestone. As early as August, just weeks after the start of the First World War, the Folkestone War Refugees Committee was created, with several national newspapers running a Belgian relief fund. It is estimated that 100,000 Belgians passed through Folkestone, fleeing advancing German troops. Each person who arrived was examined by a doctor and given food. Those that could rented rooms in the hotels, those who did not have the means were put up by people in the town who had opened their homes to those in need.
JAN21	I want Brexit to tear the main parties apart – at least we’d have a shot at a fairer voting system	Perhaps I’m just a starry-eyed optimist, but I’m starting to hope that the silver lining of the potential Brexit calamity is that both of the largest parties could tear themselves apart. That could leave us with a parliament of several parties of former Labour and Conservative members, and a few more, Lib Dems, Greens and others.
JAN21	A Brexit coup could shift the balance of parliamentary power forever – but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing	From the moment Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, the title of his colleague Chris Mullin’s novel was destined to become a political cliché. What no one foresaw back in September 2015 is that “a very British coup” would come to be applied not to a covert intelligence service’s plan to remove a hard-left PM, but to an overt move by a Tory backbencher to seize the power to legislate from a Tory government.
JAN22	I advised the Electoral Commission on Brexit – this is why Theresa May needs a new referendum to pass her deal	Britain is in a political crisis like no other in our lifetime. Normally, any prime minister losing a vote on a flagship policy of her party’s manifesto would resign immediately. Yet Theresa May limps on, winning a no-confidence vote thanks to the goodwill of DUP MPs. The main question now is what next? Some who saw parliament’s rejection of May’s Brexit deal believe it is time for a second referendum that might pull the plug on Brexit altogether. MPs finding May’s deal too soft want the UK to prepare itself for a no-deal exit with virtually no time left to do so. Neither side has a majority in parliament and so the country – as well as May’s premiership – is in limbo.
JAN22	Come on feminists, ditch the makeup bag. It's a far more radical statement than burning your bra	Since childhood, I have always balked at the idea of smothering my face in various pastes and powders in the name of “beauty”. Now that I am supposed to be doing it in order to reverse signs of natural ageing, I feel exactly the same way. But vast numbers of women endure the daily routine of applying makeup. First goes on the moisturiser, then spot concealer, eyeliner, mascara, blush, lip liner, lipstick and powder.
JAN22	The new domestic violence laws sound good but they could be utterly useless – here’s why	Today the government has launched its “landmark” draft Domestic Abuse Bill. The document draws on evidence from an open consultation in 2017, which received more than 3,000 submissions and discussions, with more than 1,000 people in England and Wales including survivors and practitioners working with those affected by domestic violence. Until now there has been no single dedicated law or policy concerning domestic violence and abuse, although there have been several important developments over the past decade. An updated cross-party definition of domestic violence and abuse was established in 2013, and domestic violence and abuse has featured heavily in the Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy. Moreover, specific types of abuse have received increased attention, including coercive control which was made a standalone offence in 2015. New sentencing guidelines were released in 2018 recognising the seriousness of domestic violence-related offences, which are rarely isolated incidents.
JAN22	Davos can still be a force for meaningful change, even if the global elite aren’t	Davos is here again this week. The small mountain town in Switzerland, a health spa before it became a ski resort, is host once again to the annual meeting of the global elite – the industrialists, politicians and other leaders who run the world economy – at the World Economic Forum. Figures like these have been dubbed “Davos man” by the American political scientist Samuel P Huntington, who in 2004 wrote a paper about “an emerging global superclass”.
JAN22	Theresa May is wrong to claim there's no time for a people’s vote – here’s how we can easily make it happen within months	In politics the constraints of time all too often override the considerations of principle and practicality. That is where we are this week: the prime minister is desperately trying to delay firm decision-making by MPs, in the hope that they will be forced to accept that her bad deal is less disastrous than a crash-out no deal. Ministers are also seeking to head off the increasingly strident, cross-party backing of the Liberal Democrat call for a people’s vote – where the public are given the chance to weigh up the government’s Brexit option against the advantages of staying in the EU on current terms. This is being fought with claims by the government that “there isn’t time”. Their back-of-an-envelope estimate, with no supporting evidence, is that the legislation and campaign would take 12 months.
JAN22	Far from a ‘coup’, this democratic step could give the people a Final Say on Brexit	If in the end parliament decides to allow the British people the final say on Brexit in a new referendum, Sir Keir Starmer, Yvette Cooper and Dominic Grieve will be leading names among those who should be praised for doing their democratic duty.  Sir Keir has fought tenaciously to keep the leader of the Labour Party from closing off the option of another referendum, which is overwhelmingly supported by its members. Today the shadow Brexit secretary kept up the pressure by saying, in a speech to the Fabian Society, that, if the party could not force a general election, there were only “two remaining options”. 
JAN22	Now Kamala Harris is a 2020 candidate, Trump stands no chance at winning another election	Kamala Harris just ruined Donald Trump’s day. With her much anticipated declaration today, she immediately installed herself as a front-runner in the race to be the Democrat intent on taking down the president in 2020. “Let’s do this together: For ourselves, for our children, for our country,” she said.
JAN22	How a lawsuit against Tommy Robinson could open up a new front in the battle against the far right	Tommy Robinson, or Stephen Yaxley-Lennon to give him his real name, has had quite a year. The founder of the English Defence League has spent time in prison for alleged contempt of court, whipped up angry crowds in front of the Old Bailey, doorstepped critics in the dead of night, and is now attempting to set up his own social network. Last week, he went to Glasgow to confront Stewart McDonald, the SNP MP who had called him a “racist thug and fraudster” in the House of Commons last year. It is turning into common strategy.
JAN22	Ableism is rife enough in real life – of course disabled people need protection from online abuse too	The online and offline worlds are both important, and people need to be treated equally in both spaces. They also need to be taken seriously when they say a crime has happened online or offline. For too long, people with learning disabilities and autism have been excluded from digital spaces out of a fear of abuse – particularly in the form of grooming or so-called mate crime.
JAN22	Theresa May must put an end to Brexit groundhog day – by backing a Final Say	Albert Einstein had better things to do than get himself elected to the British parliament. Still, his often-quoted remark (possibly apocryphal) that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results” deserves to be displayed in very large letters across the chamber of the House of Commons, preferably in the direct eyeline of the prime minister. How many times has Theresa May been to Brussels, asked for a change to the Irish backstop and been told “no” in a wide variety of the 24 official languages of the European Union?
JAN23	I work at a Wetherspoons in grim conditions – and Tim Martin’s clueless Brexit bleating is driving me mad	Brexit, according to the latest edition of Wetherspoon News, is a route to “democracy and free trade”, to “equal freedom and prosperity”. Following an appraisal of the implications of a no-deal Brexit, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin has informed attentive Fosters drinkers across the country that Britain crashing out of the EU would be no greater trouble than his company’s triumphant substitution of German Jägermeister with English Strika. Any other spin, he claims, is “just another pro-EU shaggy dog story” desperately cobbled together by a “metropolitan elite”. You’re even invited to his once-in-a-lifetime countrywide Brexit tour were any of your doubts to persist.
JAN23	Seattle's homelessness crisis is getting worse – no amount of big tech philanthropy can undo Microsoft’s damage	One thing Microsoft deserves credit for over its announcement of $500m (£383m) to help address the shortage of affordable housing is the admission of the role of big tech in worsening the problem. When it made this region its headquarters in 1979, it had just 30 employees. Today that number is close to 40,000 – all of them helping to push up the cost of buying or renting homes. “Since 2011, jobs in the region have grown 21 per cent, while growth in housing construction has lagged at 13 per cent,” wrote company president Brad Smith and chief financial officer Amy Hood. “This gap in available housing has caused housing prices to surge 96 per cent in the past eight years.”
JAN23	Theresa May should have resigned long ago. We deserve better than this	The catastrophic handling of Brexit highlights to what extent our political process is now mired in the mud. Theresa May has suffered no fewer than 27 Commons defeats, 10 of them in connection with Brexit. In no previous era of British politics could such a calamitous prime minister have survived such a weight of defeats, including the humiliating historic loss she recently suffered over the withdrawal agreement.
JAN23	Violence in Zimbabwe obscures the potential for a bright future	The world can be sure that the renewed crisis in Zimbabwe is serious when its president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, cancels a comfortable sojourn at the Davos economic summit, at which he was due to inveigle the Russians, the Chinese and anyone else he encountered into “investing” in his freshly bankrupt state. He will have to pass the hat around another time. The proximate cause of the current civil unrest is the high price of fuel, said to be the most expensive in the world. The reality behind that is a government running out of money (again), with no viable economic policy, crippled by corruption, but determined to hang on to power.
JAN23	I left the Women’s Equality Party because members were ignored – if it wants change, it should start there	I believe I was the third member to join the Waltham Forest and Newham branch of the Women's Equality Party (WEP) in July 2015. We had our first proper meeting in a pub in Leyton, and were full of optimism and “deeds not words” spirit. Shortly after the first WEP conference, in Manchester in 2017, I cancelled my membership. I was branch secretary at that point, and had recruited a personal contact to WEP to stand in the June 2016 London General Assembly elections (I had also nominated myself for consideration as a candidate), and actively canvassed and campaigned in that election period.
JAN23	Come on feminists, ditch the makeup bag. It's a far more radical statement than burning your bra	Since childhood, I have always balked at the idea of smothering my face in various pastes and powders in the name of “beauty”. Now that I am supposed to be doing it in order to reverse signs of natural ageing, I feel exactly the same way. But vast numbers of women endure the daily routine of applying makeup. First goes on the moisturiser, then spot concealer, eyeliner, mascara, blush, lip liner, lipstick and powder.
JAN23	Not even a homophobic TV host is safe from Egypt's populist lurch towards cultural piety	An Egyptian TV host, Mohamed al-Ghiety, has been sentenced to a year’s hard labour and 3,000 Egyptian pounds fine for interviewing a gay man on prime time. It is a depressing reminder of the Egyptian state’s hard-line position LGBTQ issues – and its contempt for journalism. Charged under outdated blasphemy and debauchery laws, the TV presenter has been accused of “inciting homosexuality” after questioning a man, whose face was not visible, about his sexuality, his life as a sex worker, his fears and regrets.
JAN23	Ocasio-Cortez and the LA teachers strike are doing the impossible – bringing socialism back to America	Los Angeles teachers union president Alex Caputo-Pearl told a roaring crowd of 60,000 striking teachers last Friday to imagine they were a boxer whose blows had just dazed their “opponent”: the city’s school district leadership. “Do you know what you do when your opponent is stunned? You double down and keep on punching them more, and you try to end it right there.” This is unusually strident rhetoric from teachers. But American educators are restless these days. They’re in the mood to fight.
JAN23	With EU nationals already struggling to stay in the UK, I can only hope my family is not torn apart by Brexit	Back in December the Home Office released a video about the new settled status scheme for EU nationals. The video showed people smiling and looking happy. But the tone of the video was widely condemned as being hopelessly out of touch with the feelings of the 3.9 million EU nationals who have made the UK their home.  When I knocked on doors for Remain in the referendum, I met entire households who were unable to vote. Now, they are forced to make a choice they never anticipated having to make and endure aggravation that they never expected to put up with – just to stay in their home. 
JAN23	Don’t plough your digger into a hotel if you haven’t been paid – there is an alternative	“That’s what happens when you don’t pay your wages, mate” is the defining cry of the now viral video of a builder driving a digger into a Travelodge after his employer allegedly failed to pay him £600. While the response by this worker has surprised many, what potentially instigated it should come as no surprise.
JAN24	Alex Salmond's arrest has exposed the war raging within the SNP	Today’s arrest of Alex Salmond marks a new chapter in the police’s investigations and a move on from the botched nature of the Scottish government’s inquiry. With luck, the investigation will be swift, but the allegations against Salmond have brought to the fore tensions within the party that threaten to split it down the middle, with the two great personalities of the independence movement staring across from either side.
JAN24	Why American figures like Michelle Alexander are breaking their silence on Israel	Most folk outside the United States – and until this month, most Americans – won’t have heard of Michelle Alexander. She’s a civil rights lawyer and academic and has written a book called The New Jim Crow, and a few months ago The New York Times took her on as a regular columnist. Like millions of black – and white – Americans, she’s a devotee of Martin Luther King Jr. And last week, she began her op-ed in the Old Gray Lady of record and one-time conservatism with a long and admiring tribute to the black, Christian, nonviolent civil rights campaigner who, just a year before his 1968 assassination, decided he must speak out about the disaster of the Vietnam war.
JAN24	As a young gay man, the life of centenarian Diana Athill taught me so much	Diana Athill, the famed literary editor who has died aged 101, recently described her first encounter with a homosexual – with whom she shared a bed once – sometime before the war. “I only just knew what a homosexual was,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Here I am! In bed with a homosexual, drinking whisky. This is bliss! This is heaven! It instantly made me accept people for what they were.” In the middle of last century, while working as a literary editor, Athill published the greats: Jean Rhys, Philip Roth and VS Naipaul were on her books, but it was later in life that Athill’s stigma-breaking memoirs made her famous beyond the shielded world of literature.
JAN24	Jeremy Corbyn, please stand by the British people and give them a Final Say on Brexit	The Labour leader was criticised today by some of his MPs for failing to support a new referendum on leaving the European Union. Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna this morning joined the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who planned to table an amendment next week, to announce that they had decided against it.  Ms Berger put the blame firmly on Jeremy Corbyn: “At a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.” Without an indication from Mr Corbyn that he would ask Labour MPs to support it, the amendment stood no prospect of success, and so the cross-party group were wise to hold fire. 
JAN24	Mob culture could be the least of our worries after Brexit	In response to Ian Richards’ letter I would agree that no politician should encourage or excuse a violent response should the UK remain in the EU despite the referendum result. However, I think there is a much greater risk to the country should we fail to leave, in the form of apathy and disillusion with the very idea that this is a country where events are determined via the ballot box.
JAN24	If Ridley Road Market closes down, there will be no going back for east London	When my parents moved from Nigeria to London in the Eighties they probably didn’t envisage the “ultra-trendy” upbringing I would have as our Shoreditch home was engulfed by first-wave hipsters. What I would experience as “cool” would actually turn out to be the plight of the gentrification, which would see house prices in Hoxton reach the millions by the time I neared the age the new arrivals were when they bought their first home.
JAN24	Let’s call out Trump’s intervention in Venezuela for what it is: an undemocratic coup	Donald Trump has promptly recognised formerly-unknown quantity Juan Guaidó as his interim president of Venezuela. Without taking the trouble to wait for elections, Guaidó proclaimed himself president and swore himself before almighty God and the cameras. Pictures reproduced around the world show him holding a constitution, approved during Hugo Chavez’s administration, with liberator Simon Bolivar on its cover. The stunt is supposed to send a message to millions of Venezuelans outside the mostly urban, middle-upper class strongholds of the right-wing opposition, and the world, who before yesterday had never heard of Mr Guaidó, that he too recognises the Bolivarian foundations of the Republic, historical and more recent.
JAN24	Even Tim Martin's no-deal Brexit Wetherspoons tour has descended into open warfare	For some time now, JD Wetherspoons has been serving up its cut price drinks right alongside the cut price opinions of its lager magnate turned TV camera magnet boss Tim Martin. But, here at The Velvet Coaster, right on Blackpool promenade, it is coming as something of a shock to see the former going down rather more easily than the latter. It is, roughly, pub number 98 on Martin’s roughly 100 stop, “Free Trade” Tour, a kind of 19th-century Liberal tribute act with added Bud Light. As though the pro-Brexit leaflets, newsletters and beer mats that have been distributed with uncharacteristic generosity throughout his 900 boozers over the past three years were not enough, now Martin himself is coming to tell them all in person. And he’s coming, specifically, to tell them no-deal Brexit is the best Brexit there is, and how this particular version of Brexit – which is more commonly described as either “catastrophic” or “national suicide” – is in fact the land of milk and honey, and absolutely, definitely, nothing for the kind of person who likes their drinks poured from behind the nation’s ruthlessly cheapest bars to worry about. 
JAN24	Airbus believes in Britain but the Tory Brexiteers do not – so who do you think we should listen to?	Airbus believes in Britain. You only need to look at the vast resources it has committed to this country to see that. Every wing on one of the company’s commercial aircraft will have been designed and manufactured right here, and the company employs 14,000 people at 25 sites dotted up and down our island.  But that’s just the start of it.
JAN24	How to destroy Davos – and rebuild something revolutionary from the ashes	Dunking on Davos is an annual pastime, and this year is no exception. Reams of tweets and hot takes have taken aim at the hapless elites roaming around the World Economic Forum. They fly private planes to a climate panel. They step out of their five-star hotels to visit an exhibition on the refugee crisis. They applaud autocrats who promise to lower taxes, and they scoff at representatives who suggest that we raise them. All of it feels absurd, and commentators are rolling their eyes accordingly. 
JAN25	Greta Thunberg’s speech at Davos shows that if anyone is going to save the world, it’s Generation Z	Considering the icy temperatures gripping central Europe, it’s remarkable how much hot air was able to circulate in the small town of Davos at over 5,000 feet this week. As per usual, the annual WEF gathering of politicians, business leaders, celebrities and the global media delivered a healthy portion of pomp and splendour. Brexit-weary journalist friends who managed to get their hands on a coveted accreditation shared selfies with Bill Gates, a hastily snapped picture of a star-struck Prince William as he prepared to face David Attenborough, and a shaky video of Wycliffe Jean serenading a dinner crowd.  The philanthropic (and not so philanthropic) regulars donned their Monclers and rocked up in force – Bono, Al Gore, Matt Damon, George Soros, and Sting, to name but a random few – but when the supposed leaders of the free world got down to the noble business of actually safeguarding our future under the grand theme of “Globalization 4.0”, it all got a bit uncomfortable.
JAN25	Tory Eurosceptics are playing games with Theresa May's Brexit deal – she must realise before it’s too late	They celebrated by quaffing champagne at Jacob Rees-Mogg’s £5m Westminster home after inflicting the record 230 vote Commons defeat on Theresa May’s Brexit deal. But the morning after, the celebrations of the hardline Brexiteers fell flat. They realised they might unintentionally kill their longstanding dream, as rival MPs mobilised for a soft Brexit, a Final Say referendum or to block a no deal exit on 29 March. So, led by Rees-Mogg, the hardliners transmogrified themselves into softies who might back May’s agreement after all. Strangely, the European Research Group‘s (ERG) move came without any concessions by May, who in a rather surreal Commons statement on Monday vowed to plough on with her deal as if her humiliating defeat had not happened.
JAN25	Mea Culpa: ‘Elite: a select group that is superior to the rest of society’	It may have been because I disagreed so strongly with the argument of Otto English’s article that I objected to the headline we put on it: “It’s not elitist to admit the public have no clue about Brexit.” Well, of course it is. That is a textbook example of an extreme kind of elitism: to think that decisions should be taken on behalf of people who know less than the chosen few.  What we meant was, “It’s not wrong...”. Which is an opinion, albeit one that I believe to be dangerously mistaken: I think it is an argument against democracy. 
JAN25	It’s no surprise that violent crime is on the rise – there is no leadership in this country	 So – violent crime is up by 19 per cent over half a decade. There are the usual causes.
JAN25	As a young gay man, the life of centenarian Diana Athill taught me so much	Diana Athill, the famed literary editor who has died aged 101, recently described her first encounter with a homosexual – with whom she shared a bed once – sometime before the war. “I only just knew what a homosexual was,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Here I am!

What I would experience as “cool” would actually turn out to be the plight of the gentrification, which would see house prices in Hoxton reach the millions by the time I neared the age the new arrivals were when they bought their first home.
JAN25	The James Bulger film has shown the Oscars up for what they are – an outdated, unethical institution that needs to be abolished	The Academy Awards are universally considered the most important night in the film calendar. Dreams are made, hopes are dashed and fake conciliatory smiles and gorgeous gowns make up its unofficial dress code. Yet what should be a night of jubilation never manages to go a year without entering murky ethical waters. This year, as the big night approaches, a controversy surrounding Detainment – a film written and directed by Irish filmmaker Vincent Lambe that reconstructs the police interrogation of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the 10-year-olds convicted of brutally murdering Liverpudlian toddler Jamie Bulger in 1993 – is gathering pace.
JAN25	If we remain in the European Union, the UK must rebuild its relationship with democracy	It is one of the great unhelpful myths of the referendum that the vote represented a clear political statement by a definable socioeconomic group: it did not. It split classes as effectively as it split families. Leave would not have prevailed without the support of affluent boomers in the southeast, whose anger was not about austerity but sovereignty. Both sound as though they occupy the political space of the “high concept”, yet one is a concrete set of policies creating measurable deprivation, while the other is an infinitely interpretable quality which people now prepared to die in a ditch for hadn’t mentioned in any of the previous five decades. So let’s park the Surrey Leavers for now, whose anguished call for the world as it was cannot really be met by democratic means. Undoubtedly, the votes to leave the European Union in the north and northeast mapped closely onto those areas hit hardest by the conservative policy of fiscal contraction.
JAN25	Society insists that laziness makes us fat – now science proves this is baseless bigotry	Few people hear the word “fat” and don’t respond with a subconscious visceral reaction. It’s what the bullies shouted at you in school, what the media has always implied you are – or even worse: will become. It’s the food to avoid, or to divide into “good” and “bad” categories and obsess over which to eat and when. It makes you feel guilty, ashamed, defective. Words which exist to oppress people typically go one of two ways: society either comes to realise the problematic implications of them and they (mostly) fade into oblivion as they become less and less acceptable to use (“retarded”); or the communities affected by the term choose to remove the word’s power by reclaiming it as a point of pride (“queer”).
JAN25	The Queen has gone too far – it’s not her place to meddle in Brexit	It is ironic that, having been almost palpably fearful of the Prince of Wales’s reputation for “interfering” in political matters, the Queen should have made such a frank and powerful intervention in the Brexit debate.  A call for “compromise” usually sounds reasonable, like the appeal she made for the nation to cool it during her Christmas message. However, it is probably the wrong thing to do, if I may be impertinent.
JAN26	Amid scores of Brexit amendments and chaos in parliament, there are only two votes that really matter – here’s why	Tuesday will be a big day in the Brexit story. We have had historic votes and critical moments before, but this is up another notch. The vote on the amendment jointly proposed by Yvette Cooper, Labour MP, and Nick Boles, Conservative MP, will be both historic and critical.  It will be historic because it is the first time since the 17th century that the House of Commons has tried to take control of the nation’s affairs from the government. And it will be critical because no one knows which way the vote will go. 
JAN26	I'm deafblind because my mother didn't get the rubella jab – now anti-vaxxers on social media are putting countless children at risk	My name is Emma Blackmore and I’m deafblind. My condition is a result of being born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). I contracted rubella though my mother, who had been exposed to German measles during pregnancy. When she discovered she was pregnant, being of a young age and frightened of the response of those around her, she didn’t tell anyone or receive medical support. Because of this she didn’t receive the rubella vaccination and now I live with a range of complex health and medical needs.
JAN26	Young people need to do more than give speeches if they really want to tackle climate change	It was encouraging to read of Greta Thunberg’s speech to the rich and powerful at Davos. The contrast between this 16-year-old’s sincerity, rationality and lack of hypocrisy, and the environmentally damaging lifestyles of the elite members of her audience, was clear.  However, the idea that young people (or Generation Z or X) are necessarily adopting seriously green behaviour is unfortunately far from the truth. Many that I know think nothing of hopping on a plane to Barcelona, Bali or Bogota for a holiday, thereby stomping a big carbon footprint purely for their own pleasure. Some people need to fly for family, educational, political, journalistic or business reasons (although I’m sure some of this is unnecessary) but a huge amount of air travel is for holidays and frequent vacation fliers include wealthier retired people, the middle-aged and twenty-somethings.
JAN26	The Top 10: Asymmetrical Animals	After I came across a wonderful blog post on asymmetrical aircraft, Paul Johns pointed out that the wrybill is an asymmetrical bird, and Dean Bullen suggested a list of the Top 10 such animals – strictly, those “featuring external asymmetry”, as most animals’ interior organs are not symmetrical.  1. Plaice. Young plaice and other flounders are symmetrical but as they spend more time on the sea bed one eye grows round to the side that faces upwards. Nominated by Dean Bullen. As An Hiro pointed out, this nomination takes first plaice. 
JAN26	The situation in Venezuela could easily spiral into civil war – it’s time for the world to take a step back	There may be some gallows humour to be had in the fact Venezuela now has two men “pretending” to be president, but neither of them actually governing this benighted country. However, the situation has never been so combustible since the late Hugo Chavez came to power almost exactly a decade ago on a programme of leftist nationalist populism, or Bolivarianism to use the correct local branding. Since Mr Chavez died in 2013, his arbitrary policies have been pursued virtually unchanged by his successor (or one of them) Nicolas Maduro. It is Mr Maduro who is accused of fixing the elections last May for his second presidential term, with the allegations so serious that the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, has decided to swear himself in as president as well.
JAN26	The Western world may no longer underestimate Isis, but we've failed to learn the most important lessons from its rise and fall	It is always pleasing for authors to find out that they have readers in far flung places. It was therefore surprising but gratifying to see a picture of a battered copy of a French translation of a book I wrote called The Jihadis Return abandoned by Isis fighters, along with suicide vests and homemade explosive devices, as they retreat from their last enclaves in Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria. The book was written in 2014 when Isis was at the height of its success after capturing Mosul, and was sweeping through western Iraq and eastern Syria. I described the Isis victories and tried to explain how the movement had apparently emerged from nowhere to shock the world by establishing the Islamic State, an entity which at its height ruled 8 million people and stretched from the the outskirts of Baghdad to the Mediterranean.
JAN26	Greta Thunberg’s speech at Davos shows that if anyone is going to save the world, it’s Generation Z	Considering the icy temperatures gripping central Europe, it’s remarkable how much hot air was able to circulate in the small town of Davos at over 5,000 feet this week. As per usual, the annual WEF gathering of politicians, business leaders, celebrities and the global media delivered a healthy portion of pomp and splendour. Brexit-weary journalist friends who managed to get their hands on a coveted accreditation shared selfies with Bill Gates, a hastily snapped picture of a star-struck Prince William as he prepared to face David Attenborough, and a shaky video of Wycliffe Jean serenading a dinner crowd.  The philanthropic (and not so philanthropic) regulars donned their Monclers and rocked up in force – Bono, Al Gore, Matt Damon, George Soros, and Sting, to name but a random few – but when the supposed leaders of the free world got down to the noble business of actually safeguarding our future under the grand theme of “Globalization 4.0”, it all got a bit uncomfortable.
JAN26	Trump has caved and reopened the government, but at a huge cost to the Republicans	Donald Trump has finally thrown in the towel. After a partial shutdown of the US federal government that lasted a record 35 days, the president showed yesterday that he’s not exempt from the standard pressures of Washington. His poll numbers dipping steadily – and the collateral damage from the shutdown adding up – Trump ultimately resolved that he had no choice but to concede to the Democrats. The result is a temporary end to America’s “shutdown showdown.” Not only did Trump not receive the $5.7bn (£4.3bn) of funding that he demanded for a US-Mexico border wall, but he came out of the shutdown in perhaps the weakest and most demoralised position of his entire presidency. That he exposed his fellow congressional Republicans – who stood loyally behind the White House throughout the shutdown – to a humiliating defeat only magnifies the weight of Trump’s losses. 
JAN26	If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from the shutdown, it’s that Donald Trump can in fact be beaten	American politics is familiar with the concept of temporary things that are really permanent. It is conventional for candidates who are running for president to “suspend” their campaigns when it is obvious that they have been beaten.  Thus no one believes that Donald Trump’s deal to end the partial federal shutdown is “temporary”. The president has been comprehensively outmanoeuvred by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of House of Representatives, and the Democrats are not going to give him the funding he demanded for his Mexican border wall. 
JAN26	Brexit has shown the crucial flaw in our democracy – there is only one way to solve it	Brexit is but one crevasse of a constitutional crisis as deep as the Mariana Trench. We see this crisis in the dark money that flooded into the referendum campaign, through Britain’s network of overseas territories and crown dependencies.
JAN27	There’s been a drop in women getting smear tests – prudish British sexual attitudes are costing lives	With the number of UK women attending cervical cancer screenings at a 21-year low, Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust recently conducted a survey to find out why. The results showed that the prevailing reason why those surveyed had avoided or skipped screening was not fear (71 per cent) or feeling vulnerable (75 per cent), but “embarrassment” (81 per cent), with women citing anxieties about the smell and appearance of their vulva. Many have immediately jumped to lecturing women, saying that their embarrassment is “unwarranted” or even “silly”, but this fails to address quite why so many feel the same way. The fact is that in Britain, our cultural aversion to openly discussing gynaecological and sexual health is the culprit. It’s cultivated shame, embarrassment and, consequently, a dangerous decline in screening numbers.
JAN27	The public don’t understand no-deal Brexit – so it’s time we properly discussed it in parliament	Many Leave voters think crashing out of the EU would be just fine. MPs, who have never discussed no deal properly, now need to say why that’s not so. A series of amendments on Tuesday – notably those from Yvette Cooper, Rachel Reeves, Caroline Spelman and Dominic Grieve – are attempts to stop us crashing out. They are all important. But we also need a grown-up debate where all the arguments both for and against no deal can be aired.
JAN27	The Molly Russell case is yet more evidence of urgent need for social media regulation	Another day, another threat by ministers to legislate unless the social media giants put their house in order. The latest warning, about online material on self-harm which may have contributed to teenage suicides, follows the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian is convinced she was driven to suicide in November 2017 by material on Pinterest, the online scrapbook, and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Pinterest sent Molly an email a month after she died, including images of self-harm and the words: “I can’t tell you how many times I wish I was dead.” Papyrus, a charity working to prevent suicide, is talking to 30 families who believe social media played a part in the suicide of their children. Pinterest said it was committed to “preventing the spread of potentially harmful content”. Instagram insisted that “for many young people, discussing their mental health journey or connecting with others who have battled similar issues is an important part of their recovery. This is why we don’t remove certain content and instead offer people looking at, or posting it, support when they might need it most”.
JAN27	We must never forget the horror inflicted upon Europe’s Jews	Six per cent of UK citizens believe the Nazi holocaust is fake news, that the thousands of survivors of the Nazi death camps and the witnesses (including personal accounts of hundreds of British, American, Russian and German soldiers, Jewish Sonderkommandos and Waffen-SS, including Rudolf Höss, the man responsible for the administration of Auschwitz/Berkenau who admitted everything in his memoirs) are all liars, and, against literally a mountain of incontrovertible physical, audio/visual, personal and bureaucratic evidence listing the number, race, ethnicity and actual names of the murdered, that the Holocaust never happened. Even in the face of more recent proven bigoted genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia and Cambodia, and political genocide in China, do they refuse to accept the truth. It’s even worse than that though. The conservative estimate for the total number of non-combatant human beings murdered for political reasons in Europe from 1933-45 is 17 million. By far the largest group were the Jews of Europe who were hunted down and persecuted and murdered (even from the British Channel Islands they were deported to their deaths), but when this number of humans is involved we are all part of this terrible event. In denying through bigotry the truth of the Jewish “Shoa”, they deny the broader definition of what took place, that their relatives probably died in it, and so they deny their responsibility to discover and admit the truth and mourn their own dead.
JAN27	Democrats have called Trump’s bluff – it’s time for MPs to do the same with Theresa May’s no-deal Brexit threat	If you’ve sat at the table for 20 minutes and still don’t know who the sucker is, runs an ancient poker maxim, the sucker is you. What goes for poker goes in spades for ultimate stakes political negotiating, as confirmed by the popular transatlantic slapstick double act of Trump and May.
JAN27	Young people need to do more than give speeches if they really want to tackle climate change	It was encouraging to read of Greta Thunberg’s speech to the rich and powerful at Davos. The contrast between this 16-year-old’s sincerity, rationality and lack of hypocrisy, and the environmentally damaging lifestyles of the elite members of her audience, was clear.  However, the idea that young people (or Generation Z or X) are necessarily adopting seriously green behaviour is unfortunately far from the truth. Many that I know think nothing of hopping on a plane to Barcelona, Bali or Bogota for a holiday, thereby stomping a big carbon footprint purely for their own pleasure. Some people need to fly for family, educational, political, journalistic or business reasons (although I’m sure some of this is unnecessary) but a huge amount of air travel is for holidays and frequent vacation fliers include wealthier retired people, the middle-aged and twenty-somethings.
JAN27	If Britain chooses to stay in the EU, the government must then embark on a mass house-building programme	Each year, around 10 per cent of the entire spending on welfare by the UK government is spent on housing benefit: for comparison, that’s 10 times the amount spent on unemployment benefits, and a quarter of what is spent on pensions, which represents the bulk of social security expenditure. The vast majority of housing benefit is paid to private landlords, by people who are in work, but not earning enough to afford a roof over their head without government assistance.
JAN27	Amid scores of Brexit amendments and chaos in parliament, there are only two votes that really matter – here’s why	Tuesday will be a big day in the Brexit story. We have had historic votes and critical moments before, but this is up another notch. The vote on the amendment jointly proposed by Yvette Cooper, Labour MP, and Nick Boles, Conservative MP, will be both historic and critical.  It will be historic because it is the first time since the 17th century that the House of Commons has tried to take control of the nation’s affairs from the government. And it will be critical because no one knows which way the vote will go. 
JAN27	Another referendum may be divisive, but to press on with Brexit would be even more so	Brexit has sliced through our politics like a warm knife through butter. The consequences of the 2016 referendum have been divisive beyond measure. The Brexit challenge has consumed the country’s ability to focus on anything else. And believe me, politicians want to focus their time on issues other than Brexit. So I can understand Ian Lavery, the chair of the Labour Party and fellow northeast MP for Wansbeck, when he says the country needs a radical Labour government to transform our country. Investment does need to be found for our public services, infrastructure and the skills we require for our economy to flourish. To restore faith in politics, if we say we are going to do all these things we should do them. There is only one problem: Brexit. You see, everything always comes back to Brexit.
JAN27	The huge hidden economic impact of the shutdown could take months to emerge, making it all the more worrying	How much will the shutdown of the US government have cost? The simpler the question the harder the answer, but here goes.  We have learnt a few things about the need for a government to do things, and apparently it was the disruption to La Guardia airport in New York that tipped Donald Trump into accepting a deal. Air traffic control matters, and while people will put up with a lot of stuff, not being able to fly as planned really riles them. The workers carrying out services deemed essential went on doing so without their paychecks. But as we saw, all you need is a rise in staff calling in sick for services to buckle.
JAN28	If Howard Schultz really runs in 2020, he'll be handing Trump a second term – here's why	No doubt Howard Schultz has strong views on strong coffee, and the former Starbucks boss understands plenty about building, and subsequently rescuing, a global business. We also happen to know he is a lifelong Democrat, and he has some fairly conventional centrist views on issues such as the economy, America’s national debt, trade with China, immigration and gun control. He backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. And now he’s announced he wants a run for the White House next year, not as a Democrat but as an independent. There is, apparently, a “Ready for Schultz” movement. Like one of the nerds inventing yet more exotic variations on the Starbucks macchiato or a new type of mochaccino, Schultz spots a gap in the market – between the liberal Democrats and the Trump-dominated Republican Party. It is, then, a beguiling sort of temptation for a man who has plenty of life and energy in him, and could certainly bring a great deal of common sense to policymaking in the White House. Less tweeting, more thinking, you might say.
JAN28	Filmmakers are right to sexualise Ted Bundy – here’s why	On the wave of our growing obsession with true crime and the explosion of podcasts and TV shows on the subject, Ted Bundy is back in the news. Though this has nothing to do with The Ted Bundy Tapes currently airing on Netflix with the warning: “Don’t watch it alone”. Or the 30th anniversary of his execution by electric chair, celebrated by hundreds of people chanting “burn, Bundy, burn!” outside his death chamber. Instead, critics are up in arms over a trailer for a new movie about him, entitled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. Not because of the graphic details but because they are outraged over the casting of Hollywood pretty boy, Zac Efron.
JAN28	Here's why it is racist to comment on my ‘culture’ just because you think I look Asian	A few years ago, I had a bizarre encounter in a black cab late one night. My cabbie started telling me about the sex dungeon he ran with his wife. It was a perfectly pleasant chat: nothing overtly inappropriate, and I was marvelling about what a progressive little vignette this was (not to mention the print quality of the sex dungeon leaflet he handed me) when he asked the fateful question: “What would someone of your culture make of what I’ve just told you?”
JAN28	AIDSfree: Sadiq Khan – It’s vital London plays its role in tackling stigma and wiping out this disease forever	An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence but this is no longer the case. We have made great strides in medical research, minimising the impact the virus has on people’s day-to-day lives – but there is still so much more to do. Despite significant progress, 15 people on average are still being infected every single day in our country.
JAN28	On pensions, the government has placed freedom over protection – but will it make us better off?	The “pushmi-pullyu” in the 1967 film of Doctor Dolittle was a double-headed llama, with one head facing forward and the other back. Pensions policy in the UK in recent years has borne a resemblance to this contradictory animal.
JAN28	The Molly Russell case is yet more evidence of urgent need for social media regulation	Another day, another threat by ministers to legislate unless the social media giants put their house in order. The latest warning, about online material on self-harm which may have contributed to teenage suicides, follows the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell. Her father Ian is convinced she was driven to suicide in November 2017 by material on Pinterest, the online scrapbook, and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Pinterest sent Molly an email a month after she died, including images of self-harm and the words: “I can’t tell you how many times I wish I was dead.” Papyrus, a charity working to prevent suicide, is talking to 30 families who believe social media played a part in the suicide of their children.

JAN28	Nick Clegg is right. Facebook isn’t the problem. He is	Every so often, Sir David Attenborough is asked why he thinks it is that he has come to be the most universally trusted person in the United Kingdom and, perhaps, the world. He has a tendency to make the same, short point in his reply. He has never advertised a product in his life. He has never done PR for anyone. He has turned down offers that would reach surely into the tens of millions, because, and I paraphrase here, that if you say something because someone has paid you to say it, eventually, people won’t trust what you say when you’re not being paid.
JAN28	The gulf between the rich and poor is widening – we just can't see it	Inequality is on the rise in Britain, as it is across most of the West. Since the 1980s, income gains have been concentrated among the top 1 per cent, whose economic fortunes have grown at a much faster pace than the rest of society. The top 10 per cent of households now take home about a third of all income, and own two-thirds of all wealth. This widening gap between the haves and have-nots increasingly preoccupies scholars and journalists, and policymakers, all the way to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Curiously, however, the evidence suggests that few citizens share these concerns. In fact, people in some of the most unequal societies seem to be the least worried about inequality. Why is this the case?  
JAN28	The UK is in no position to lecture Venezuela over political turmoil	If I was a politician in the UK at present I would be very careful about taking the perceived moral high ground over Venezuela. Their words and intransigence could come back to bite them. Disastrous governance – as some of us are aware – is not just a foreign problem. Just look at the UK as the deadline looms for leaving the EU. The complacency and posturing is mind-boggling – we are no further forward since the unprecedented defeat for Theresa May the other week.
JAN29	This is why MPs are voting on Brexit again tonight – and why this time it really matters	There are likely to be two big votes tonight. The one on Yvette Cooper’s amendment will come first. It could be historic, because it tries to take control of Brexit away from the government – in order to take a no-deal Brexit off the table in a legally binding way.  The prime minister this afternoon described this amendment as “deeply misguided”, because it would “allow parliament to usurp the role of the executive”.
JAN29	China's authoritarianism, not Trump's bombastic premiership, is shutting Huawei out of the west	 A robot called “Tappy” which monotonously jabs away at mobile phone screens does not, let’s face it, sound like the most sophisticated of technologies. So it’s possible to feel a degree of sympathy with the Chinese firm Huawei which finds itself accused by the US Justice Department of the theft of this supposedly bleeding-edge bit of intellectual property from T-Mobile. The phrase “trumped-up charges” (in every sense) comes to mind.
JAN29	At the age of 58, I’ve finally started to behave myself – and it’s not all that bad	I have spent my entire life not really doing what I’m told. At school I never really listened to anything that was going on at the front of the class – I was far more interested in what was going on at the back of the class and writing notes under the desk to my mates in tiny handwriting about who I fancied and how I was going to “get off with them”. My O level results were lousy and, even though I was meant to be “good at English”, I got a terrible grade for my A level, possibly because I attempted to read Bleak House the night before the exam, not realising the thing was 700 pages long. I have applied this lack of concentration and waywardness to just about every element of my life since I was very young.
JAN29	The Molly Russell case is yet more evidence of urgent need for social media regulation	Another day, another threat by ministers to legislate unless the social media giants put their house in order. The latest warning, about online material on self-harm which may have contributed to teenage suicides, follows the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.

JAN29	The situation in Venezuela could easily spiral into civil war – it’s time for the world to take a step back	There may be some gallows humour to be had in the fact Venezuela now has two men “pretending” to be president, but neither of them actually governing this benighted country. However, the situation has never been so combustible since the late Hugo Chavez came to power almost exactly a decade ago on a programme of leftist nationalist populism, or Bolivarianism to use the correct local branding. Since Mr Chavez died in 2013, his arbitrary policies have been pursued virtually unchanged by his successor (or one of them) Nicolas Maduro. It is Mr Maduro who is accused of fixing the elections last May for his second presidential term, with the allegations so serious that the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, has decided to swear himself in as president as well.
JAN29	Jeremy Corbyn, please stand by the British people and give them a Final Say on Brexit	The Labour leader was criticised today by some of his MPs for failing to support a new referendum on leaving the European Union. Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna this morning joined the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who planned to table an amendment next week, to announce that they had decided against it.  Ms Berger put the blame firmly on Jeremy Corbyn: “At a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.” Without an indication from Mr Corbyn that he would ask Labour MPs to support it, the amendment stood no prospect of success, and so the cross-party group were wise to hold fire. 
JAN29	Here's why the Northern Ireland backstop is so crucial – and why Brexit hardliners are sabotaging democracy	Despite being the circle that could never be squared, Northern Ireland remains the least understood aspect of the Brexit psychodrama. Anyone tuning into the BBC’s Today programme on Saturday in the hope of enlightenment, will have been sorely disappointed. Listeners to John Humphry’s belligerent interview with Irish minister, Helen McEntee, would be forgiven for thinking that Brexit was Ireland’s idea.
JAN29	Pakistan will have no place on the global stage unless it learns from the Asia Bibi blasphemy case	After eight years on death row, Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman is today free to leave Pakistan. The country’s Supreme Court has upheld a decision to overturn Bibi’s conviction under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has made clear the pivotal decision now facing the country.  In 2009, Bibi had been accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad by a group of women as they worked, harvesting crops in a field. She has always maintained her innocence.
JAN29	Labour’s electoral success depends on whether it backs a Final Say – now is the time for it to show its support	Theresa May’s Brexit strategy has become increasingly inward-looking. As the clock runs down each wasted day, the prime minister, rather than leading the nation, obsesses over holding together the fragile bonds of her own party. As Labour MP Hilary Benn put it, commenting on May’s offer of cross-party talks, “the prime minister said her door was open, but her mind was closed”. Labour has at least partly grasped the nettle in a way the prime minister refuses to. In its amendment tabled after May’s Monday statement, Jeremy Corbyn’s party suggested that parliament should be able to vote on options to prevent no deal and that these options should include “legislating to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons”. This is a welcome step by Labour, and gives them a serious alternative than that of being cornered into becoming an enabler of Tory Brexit.
JAN29	By dragging their feet on the Immigration Bill, Corbyn and Abbott pandered to anti-migrant sentiment	The Labour front bench’s confused response to yesterday’s vote on the Immigration Bill shows its attempt to hedge all sides of the chaotic Brexit debate can only result in a failure to effectively stand up for migrants’ rights. Voters, party members and backbenchers alike have made clear they want to see Labour present a robust challenge to the government’s damaging bill. It’s high time the leadership heard them and plotted a course that avoids embarrassing mistakes such as these. There is so much wrong with the UK immigration system as it stands, and much need for reform, but this bill will serve only to worsen conditions for migrants – particularly EU nationals and their family members. This bill not only ends freedom of movement, but allows the home secretary to implement a future system for immigration with little oversight from parliament.
JAN30	Theresa May is going back to Brussels: she might get something, but not enough for her backbenchers	What can the prime minister expect as she tries to reopen the negotiations on the Brexit deal? Remainers in the UK are too quick to take at face value protestations by the EU side that the withdrawal agreement has already been agreed and cannot be changed.  Of course the EU would change it if there were minor adjustments they thought could help to get it through the House of Commons. EU leaders don’t want the UK to leave without a deal, and they want to be helpful to Theresa May if they can. But the problem for the prime minister is that they don’t really believe she is prepared to leave without a deal, and they know that there is a majority in parliament opposed to a no-deal Brexit, as was confirmed last night. 
JAN30	The attack against Jussie Smollett shows why we shouldn't excuse racist and homophobic ‘jokes’	The world has had around 24 hours to process what happened to actor and activist Jussie Smollett yesterday. Smollett, star of Empire and a musician, survived an attack from two white in ski masks yelling “MAGA”, where he was not only called a f****t but also a n****r. The attack has justly sparked outrage, from community members, to national organizations, and even politicians. However, many are still struggling to understand how this story doesn’t just reside in racism or homophobia but both; Smollett lives in the identity of black and gay simultaneously, and that matters.
JAN30	Training Clarks employees in kids speech is a non-solution to the literacy crisis – and the government knows it	Oh to be a continental newspaper journalist with an eye on Britain in 2019. You only need to squint across the Channel and focus on this sorry island nation, run by clowns and jokers, for an abundance of material so absurd your editor would be forgiven for accusing you of fabricating it. And if – like practically anyone in any newsroom on this pitiable land mass – you start to develop the symptoms of Brexit fatigue, no need to despair: the barrel is far from dry. The UK government is the punchline that never gets old, and schooling is this week’s scapegoat of choice.
JAN30	Penny Mordaunt’s foreign aid comments make a mockery of ‘Global Britain’ after Brexit	One of the vanishingly few positive legacies of the two administrations led by David Cameron from 2010 to 2016 was the fulfilment of the United Nations pledge, long accepted by the UK, to devote 0.7 per cent of the national income to overseas aid, and towards the development of the most vulnerable people in the world. Or so it seemed. Now, according to reports, the secretary of state for international aid herself, Penny Mordaunt, an ardent Brexiteer, is questioning the way the target is being set. She appears to be in a line of Department for International Development ministers who were placed in office despite their hostility to the entire remit of their department. Her predecessor, Priti Patel, who found herself distracted by Israel, was on record as favouring the abolition of DfID. It has not been a lucky ministry for its civil servants. Ms Mordaunt says the 0.7 per cent target is “unsustainable”. Well, for sure, it is more difficult to sustain if the UK slides into a post-Brexit recession, but it is still achievable, even so.
JAN30	The Molly Russell case is yet more evidence of urgent need for social media regulation	Another day, another threat by ministers to legislate unless the social media giants put their house in order. The latest warning, about online material on self-harm which may have contributed to teenage suicides, follows the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell.

JAN30	Corbyn and May’s fantasist double act is driving MPs towards a new Brexit referendum	This morning the prime minister will have woken with the illusion that her tenacity has bought her a sustainable parliamentary majority for Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn, too, will be relieved that the spotlight will shift to Brussels, and away from his own bungling role in the Brexit affair. But this mutual relief will be short-lived. 
JAN30	Brexit Blind Dates: When Theresa met Jeremy	After a fortnight of obfuscation, Jeremy Corbyn finally agreed to meet Theresa May for "cross-party talks" to break the Brexit deadlock. But did they get on? Theresa on Jeremy
JAN30	Almost half a century after it began, here’s how America’s ‘war on drugs’ is still devastating Latin America	If you need insight into the alarming levels of social and political violence and the degradation of Latin America’s already fragile democracies in recent decades, you should pay attention to the dramatic increase of cocaine and marijuana trafficking. Since the promotion of the so-called “war on drugs” by the United States during the 1970s, crime related to drug trafficking has increased, becoming one of the key problems faced by the region. Some 50 years later, it’s worth questioning what it has meant for the countries in which narcotics are produced and trafficked.
JAN30	The ERG and Theresa May have played Tory MPs like a fiddle	I am surprised at how unintelligent some of the more sensible people in the Conservative Party appear to have been over the Remain-Leave Tory amendment that was voted on last night. Jacob Rees-Mogg and pals know full well that Brussels, Dublin and most individual EU27 leaders will reject any piecemeal legal tweak to the Irish backstop. For the European Research Group the vote yesterday evening was a gift – a chance to increase the prospect of no deal by sending May back to negotiate something she cannot win. And she knows for certain she cannot win a legal change on the backstop without reopening the whole negotiation. It is barn-door obvious that she is counting on jittery MPs voting for her idiotic version of Brexit at the very last minute to prevent no deal. For now she can continue her sneaky and dishonest claim that she is not simply running down the clock.
JAN31	As rival states jostle for power in Libya, the fate of one Gaddafi son hangs delicately in the balance	As the ninth anniversary of the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi approaches, Libya remains in a state of turmoil. Bloody clashes took place last week in the suburbs of Tripoli between rival militias while General Khalifa Haftar, the strongman saviour-in-waiting to his supporters, has launched a new offensive in the southwest. The largest oilfield of the oil-rich land remains shut, after an armed group took it over. France and the UK instigated the Nato bombing campaign that led to the fall of the Gaddafi regime during the uprising. Foreign powers are back in what is now a dismembered state. The Italians, the French, the Americans, the Russians, the Egyptians and the Emiratis are all at present backing rival blocs competing for power. The UN-backed interim government has little reach outside the capital.
JAN31	Children held in custody are in ever increasing danger – must our judges now do the unthinkable?	It has become a cliché to say that prisons in England and Wales are in crisis. At the Howard League, we have been saying that every year for at least the last five years. Can anything be in a steady state of crisis? It appears so. I defy anyone to read the statistics published today by the Ministry of Justice on safety in custody and not conclude that the prisons are in a lamentable state. I would go further and say the state of prisons today make a travesty of the law. If a prison can do anything, then at a very basic level it should be able to keep those confined within its walls safe. When somebody is sent to prison, then the punishment is deprivation of their liberty. But once behind bars, that person is in the care of the state. What we see in these latest figures is that the state is unable to “care” for those it imprisons. The statistics shine a light on just how chaotic and dangerous our overcrowded prison system has become.
JAN31	It’s time to give the EU an ultimatum on Brexit	Theresa May should stop kowtowing to the EU and take control of these negotiations. Be strong and proud of what we have in the UK, step up and use that intransigence and determination for a different direction. Go to the EU and state what we will accept – and if we don’t get that, walk away and go full tilt for a no deal. It will cost another load of millions, but how much has it cost already, not in just money, but with the extended squabbling and game playing in the Commons? The plight of the less able and the country have been ignored for too long. If the EU does come back with any offers that are short of our demands, reject them until the last moment. If the last offer is acceptable, take it; if not, carry on. The country badly needs a leader not a follower.
JAN31	Why my dad’s ill-advised purchase of a rusty old Rover is the perfect Brexit parable	In the late 1970s my parents’ neighbour, Mrs Burton, convinced my mum that my dad should buy Mr Burton’s Rover 3500. It was a lovely car, almost new, with hand stitched leather upholstered seats, a walnut trim and an automatic gear box. My father already had a car and was quite happy with it but Mrs Burton persuaded my mother that he was far too important to be driving about in a Citroen. What dad needed was a Rover – and specifically Mr Burton’s dark brown one. The car was brought round and almost immediately everything went wrong with it. Fortunately, my dad had heard about a man who lived up the road who fixed vehicles cheaply. This guy’s garden was reassuringly full of abandoned scrap and the car would be quite safe on his property on account of the vicious dogs that came hurtling out every time you paid a visit. 
JAN31	Training Clarks employees in kids speech is a non-solution to the literacy crisis – and the government knows it	Oh to be a continental newspaper journalist with an eye on Britain in 2019. You only need to squint across the Channel and focus on this sorry island nation, run by clowns and jokers, for an abundance of material so absurd your editor would be forgiven for accusing you of fabricating it. And if – like practically anyone in any newsroom on this pitiable land mass – you start to develop the symptoms of Brexit fatigue, no need to despair: the barrel is far from dry. The UK government is the punchline that never gets old, and schooling is this week’s scapegoat of choice.
JAN31	Penny Mordaunt’s foreign aid comments make a mockery of ‘Global Britain’ after Brexit	One of the vanishingly few positive legacies of the two administrations led by David Cameron from 2010 to 2016 was the fulfilment of the United Nations pledge, long accepted by the UK, to devote 0.7 per cent of the national income to overseas aid, and towards the development of the most vulnerable people in the world. Or so it seemed. Now, according to reports, the secretary of state for international aid herself, Penny Mordaunt, an ardent Brexiteer, is questioning the way the target is being set. She appears to be in a line of Department for International Development ministers who were placed in office despite their hostility to the entire remit of their department. Her predecessor, Priti Patel, who found herself distracted by Israel, was on record as favouring the abolition of DfID. It has not been a lucky ministry for its civil servants. Ms Mordaunt says the 0.7 per cent target is “unsustainable”. Well, for sure, it is more difficult to sustain if the UK slides into a post-Brexit recession, but it is still achievable, even so.
JAN31	Muslim parents, you can't have it both ways – if we’re defended against bigotry, so must the LGBT+ community	The local press in Birmingham has recently highlighted a story around an outraged Muslim mother objecting to an LGBT+ awareness session being provided at a local community school. The aim of that session, part of the “No Outsiders” programme, was “to raise awareness of these differences so that children are able to tolerate and accept differences in our society,” according to the headteacher of Parkfield Community School.
JAN31	As the UN jabs nervously at the truth about Khashoggi, remember how often journalists’ deaths are brushed aside	It’s encouraging to hear that Agnes Callamard, the UN’s execution expert, is at last in Istanbul to lead the “independent international inquiry” into the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Better late than never, perhaps, but the old UN donkey clip-clops upon the world stage according to the politics and courage of the panjandrums beside the East River in New York.  Thus Callamard arrived all of four months after Khashoggi was butchered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. And she is now politely asking the Saudis themselves – “respectfully”, she tells us – to give her access to the murder scene “at some stage”.
JAN31	I crashed an airline industry dinner with 13 other anti-deportation activists – and this is why	Last night, in protest of the involvement of commercial airlines in deportations, myself and other activists from the group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants (LGSMigrants) crashed the Airline UK Annual Dinner 2019 – attended by over 250 representatives across the airline sector and the government’s aviation minister, Baroness Liz Sugg. Why did we ruin their three-course dinner? Because commercial airlines like British Airways enter into contracts with the Home Office to carry out what are, in our view, inhumane, often violent, and unjust deportations.
JAN31	Britain’s prison estate has become a home for self-harm – an end to needless short sentences might help change that	Prisons, of necessity, have always been violent places. What is more surprising, and disturbing, is that so many prisoners are directing that violence at themselves. Suicides rose to 92 last year, from a still unacceptable 70 the previous year; acts of self-harm are up 23 per cent, to 52,814 incidents over the same period. These grim stories, each itself a human tragedy, unfold against a background of increasing lawlessness, fighting, drug abuse and the smuggling of contraband. Prison never did “work” as a method of deterring and reducing crime; it is now failing on a scale that even ministers admit is no longer tolerable. 
FEB1	Crass Brexiteer Mark Francois needs a lesson in British history – it might help him understand our strange hubris	How should Brexit be seen against the broad backdrop of British history? Analogies multiply, with the crudest coming from prominent Brexiteer MP Mark Francois who denounced the head of Airbus for writing a letter stressing the negative economic impact for Britain of leaving the EU.  Francois claimed that this was yet one more example of teutonic arrogance, adding pugnaciously, “My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-Day veteran. He never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son.” With this, he tore up the letter in front of the television cameras.  
FEB1	There is a way out of the Brexit maze for Theresa May – but it will involve cabinet resignations	The divisions opening up inside Labour over Brexit are good news for Theresa May, and might help her secure a Commons majority for a version of her deal. But here’s the surprise: the Labour splits might also be good news for Jeremy Corbyn. On Tuesday, 14 Labour MPs voted against their colleague Yvette Cooper’s plan to delay the UK’s exit by up to nine months. Another 11 defied a three-line whip by abstaining, including eight frontbenchers who, unusually, have not been sacked or reprimanded. It’s a sharp contrast to Corbyn’s sacking of Owen Smith from the shadow cabinet for calling for a Final Say referendum last March, when it was not Labour policy.
FEB1	The Tories are trying to manipulate desperate people in a bid to cling to power – it’s shameless and stupid	I’ve never thought of the Labour MP John Mann has some sort of gigolo character, the Belle de Jour of Bassetlaw. Independent minded, yes; doughty campaigner against antisemitism, for sure; possessed of an unusually fertile mind, undoubtedly. Yet there he was, on the telly, fluttering his eyebrows at his potential punters in HM Treasury: “Show me the money.” Maybe when he gets it he’ll stick it under his suspender belt.
FEB1	UK must take greater lead fighting prejudice that is costing lives	A few months ago I was sitting next to a well-known peer in the House of Lords. There had just been a question on HIV. “I don’t know what you are worried about,” he said. “No one dies from Aids any more.” It was an example of the blanket of complacency that too often has settled over the whole area, and why I congratulate The Independent on its reports over the past weeks in challenging that complacency.
FEB1	Even visa-free European holidays are not enough to make up for the rest of today’s Brexit shambles	So little good news emerges from the Brexit fiasco that even the smallest hope that what we once took for granted will be preserved in future is seized upon as though it were the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since Nixon went to China. So it is, then, with the British tradition of an impromptu weekend romantic break in Paris. The European Union has graciously agreed that UK citizens will be free to travel throughout the EU, and indeed the wider Schengen area and its associates. That means that British tourists will be free to visit the usual EU destinations, plus Switzerland, San Marino, Monaco, Iceland or Norway – all fine spots for holidaymakers. Reciprocal privileges have been offered by the UK to European Union citizens.
FEB1	Remembering Sid Vicious – long gone, but not forgotten	Sid Vicious died from a drug overdose in a New York hotel on 2 February 1979. He was one of a long list of rock musicians who died in the years 1977 to 1980, including Elvis Presley, Marc Bolan, three members of Lynyrd Skynyrd (killed in an air crash), Sandy Denny (Fairport Convention), Keith Moon (The Who), Lowell George (Little Feat), Bon Scott (AC/DC), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) and John Lennon. Sid Vicious was born Simon John Ritchie in south-east London in 1957. He met John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) at Hackney Technical College and made various attempts to join bands associated with the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. He acquired the name Sid Vicious (allegedly) after being bitten by Lydon’s pet hamster Sid – which was in turn named after Pink Floyd’s first lead singer and songwriter, Syd Barrett.
FEB1	A rerun of the 2016 Brexit vote is a terrible idea, but we do need a Final Say referendum	We’ve become so used to labelling each other. Remain or Leave, Blairite or Corbynista, centrist or far left. As a result we’ve stopped listening to each other’s arguments. So here I am – Seb Dance MEP, arch-Remainer – arguing for a public vote on Brexit. Quelle surprise! But please, if you have so far opposed a Final Say, do not stop reading here. I want to make the case for why a public vote is the only long-term, sustainable way through this crisis.
FEB1	The Brexiteer blame game is only just getting started – Remainers have to fight harder for the truth	In the days immediately before the EU referendum in 2016, it was said several times that Brexit had become rather like being pregnant, and the vote itself would be like giving birth. We were bored and irritated, we wanted it over and done with. But then, it happened, and we realised all of a sudden that the real, life-consuming struggle hadn’t even begun. We are reaching one of those moments again. People yearn for the closure of 29 March. In fact, that date, if Brexit even happens then, will mark a new and far more toxic beginning.
FEB1	Jeremy Hardy was a glorious friend and a mischievous comedian – a clown and a commentator all at once	Jeremy Hardy was brought up, he always said, in the “lower middle class in Hampshire”. To explain what this meant, he said at school he was jealous of the working-class kids, because they would get birthday presents such as a bike. But on his birthday “my dad would come into my room and say, ‘As it’s your birthday I have bought you a fountain pen, in order that you may keep a diary, like Sir Samuel Pepys. Enjoy the rest of the day’.” Jeremy travelled a few miles from his native Farnham to study politics at university in Southampton, and upon leaving began writing for the BBC Radio 4 sketch show Week Ending, in 1983. He often explained that despite this, he did have experience of manual labour, having spent one day as a car park attendant.
FEB1	Here's why Trump has made the bizarre decision to suspend a Russia nuclear treaty – and it's exactly what you would think	The world is up in arms that the US has suspended a major nuclear weapons agreement with Russia – and that’s exactly what President Trump wants. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced the US is leaving the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.
FEB2	John Bercow may have overstayed his welcome as speaker, but accusing him of bias is unfair	Order, order. Honourable members should stop complaining about the speaker of the House of Commons. Conservative MPs think he is biased, either in favour of the Labour Party or against leaving the EU, or both. They should calm down and recognise that, whatever John Bercow’s personal views, he is determined to chair their proceedings impartially.  I say that thinking he should have retired last year. While he denies allegations that he personally bullied his staff, and they have not been proven, he was criticised by Dame Laura Cox’s inquiry for failing to deal with the bullying and sexual harassment of other staff at Westminster. When he was elected speaker in 2009 he said he would serve nine years, so he should have gone last summer with a suitable expression of contrition. 
FEB2	The Pope's visit to the UAE today is the first step in undoing the damage caused by his predecessor	This week’s visit by Pope Francis to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be his first to the Arabian Peninsula and the first of its kind to the Islamic World. While the pope has previously travelled to Muslim-majority countries, this will be the first time the head of the Catholic Church will conduct what is expected to be the largest ever open-air mass in what Muslims consider to be the most religiously significant part of the Islamic world. This in a country that, like neighboring Saudi Arabia, is governed by Sharia law. The timing of the visit coincides with a period of history where radical Islamist groups have stepped up their attacks on Christians, killing them or forcing them to flee. Today, nearly all of the UAE’s one million Christians are expatriates. But Christianity is not new to the country or the Arabian Peninsula.
FEB2	Nissan’s U-turn is the beginning of the end for Britain’s revived car industry	Unconfirmed as it is, the news from Nissan Sunderland could not be more portentous. This is the beginning of the end for Britain’s revived car industry, which everyone involved did do much to build over the past 30 years.
FEB2	The truth about Brexit is that it all comes down to our relationship with Germany	Patrick Cockburn suggests that Brexiteers have no desire to reestablish the empire and he’s right. The average Brexiteer is basically a working class voter who’s noticed that their job prospects are bleak, possibly because of a flood of imported labour. Cockburn skirts around the fundamental issue though. The problem with Britain is that for over 100 years the UK hasn’t found a way to figure out a healthy relationship with Germany.
FEB2	Hugo Chavez came to power 20 years ago – and proved that the socialist dream can turn into a nightmare	It is 20 years since Hugo Chavez became the president of Venezuela.  Originally elected on the back of a populist wave, with a charismatic personality, his legacy of 14 years in office has been to drive the country into the abyss. 
FEB2	Britain’s armed forces have an enviable reputation – we should not cheapen it by playing wargames with the Saudis	Our armed forces are known around the world for their skills and their professionalism. Whether they are combating piracy off the coast of Somalia, building hospitals to fight the Ebola epidemic, or freeing civilians from the tyranny of Isis, UK servicemen and women make a crucial contribution to global peace and security.
FEB2	There is a way out of the Brexit maze for Theresa May – but it will involve cabinet resignations	The divisions opening up inside Labour over Brexit are good news for Theresa May, and might help her secure a Commons majority for a version of her deal. But here’s the surprise: the Labour splits might also be good news for Jeremy Corbyn. On Tuesday, 14 Labour MPs voted against their colleague Yvette Cooper’s plan to delay the UK’s exit by up to nine months. Another 11 defied a three-line whip by abstaining, including eight frontbenchers who, unusually, have not been sacked or reprimanded. It’s a sharp contrast to Corbyn’s sacking of Owen Smith from the shadow cabinet for calling for a Final Say referendum last March, when it was not Labour policy.
FEB2	Job interviews are a pointless waste of everyone’s time – they should be abolished	Something good will have come from the job interview from hell that made a viral sensation of Olivia Bland if it sparks a wider conversation about a painful process we nearly all go through at some point during our lives.  You would hope that the sort of character assassination Bland reported that she endured while seeking a job at an IT company is rare. But is it? 
FEB2	Trump has played straight into Putin’s hands by pulling out of the nuclear weapons treaty	In these dangerous times, Donald Trump has made an elementary error. By announcing that the United States will suspend the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, he has played into Vladimir Putin’s hands.  Instead of standing firm with America’s allies in Nato against Russian violations of the treaty, President Trump has decided to pull out of the agreement altogether in six months if Russia does not comply. This gave President Putin the excuse to announce today that Russia, too, will abandon the treaty.
FEB2	With politicians who can’t be bothered to read peace agreements, it’s no wonder Brexit negotiations are such a mess	Perhaps not a “cracking read”, to use the words of former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, but the Good Friday Agreement has been a pillar for the peace in Northern Ireland since 1998. Understanding the Good Friday Agreement is central to Brexit negotiations, a peaceful future in Northern Ireland and UK-Ireland relations. The first steps to understanding any document must be based on thorough reading. The success and support for the Good Friday Agreement deserves this, and not necessarily “over the holidays”. In such negotiations and uncertain times, equally important as reading the agreement is considering what people in Northern Ireland think about this agreement.
FEB3	If we want the Queen safe from no-deal Brexit rioters, here’s one place we could send her	Where would you hide the Queen for her protection? This question hasn’t been as relevant or urgent since she was a pubescent princess during the war, when plans were hatched to seclude the family in Canada.
FEB3	Nissan’s U-turn is the beginning of the end for Britain’s revived car industry	Unconfirmed as it is, the news from Nissan Sunderland could not be more portentous. This is the beginning of the end for Britain’s revived car industry, which everyone involved did do much to build over the past 30 years.
FEB3	Why Australia’s ailing economic situation is best understood through a Marxist lens	The big challenge in Australia right now is to tell a story to millions of workers that explains why their material standards of living are, like those of British workers, going nowhere or backwards in real terms while corporate profits have surged.   The stories being told by Australia’s major political parties are unpersuasive in this context. A more convincing story is to be found in the economics of Karl Marx.  
FEB3	Nissan’s Sunderland snub over Brexit is further proof of the Tories’ failure to lead the country	Almost two thirds of Sunderland’s electorate voted to leave the EU, despite a warning by Nissan of the advantages of remaining within the EU. Now Nissan is pulling investment on the future X-Trail SUV. The pro-Brexit lobby will claim that this has nothing to do with Brexit, but a survey of more than 1,200 companies, published on 1 February from the Institute of Directors, shows that nearly a third of companies are either moving or actively considering doing so in connection with Brexit.
FEB3	The truth about Brexit is that it all comes down to our relationship with Germany	Patrick Cockburn suggests that Brexiteers have no desire to reestablish the empire and he’s right. The average Brexiteer is basically a working class voter who’s noticed that their job prospects are bleak, possibly because of a flood of imported labour. Cockburn skirts around the fundamental issue though. The problem with Britain is that for over 100 years the UK hasn’t found a way to figure out a healthy relationship with Germany.
FEB3	Hugo Chavez came to power 20 years ago – and proved that the socialist dream can turn into a nightmare	It is 20 years since Hugo Chavez became the president of Venezuela.  Originally elected on the back of a populist wave, with a charismatic personality, his legacy of 14 years in office has been to drive the country into the abyss. 
FEB3	How Asia Bibi’s case created major change in the Pakistan government’s approach to extremism	It felt like déjà vu. After the supreme court in Pakistan rejected a challenge to the acquittal of Asia Bibi on blasphemy charges, conflicting reports of her release and departure from the country started to hit the airwaves. The nation watched with bated breath, fearful of a repeat of the events from last year when violent protesters held Pakistan hostage in the aftermath of the landmark supreme court verdict that overturned the death sentence.
FEB3	We are sliding towards the Brexit abyss: will MPs call a halt or watch the fall?	Nissan has confirmed that it will not, after all, be making the new model X-Trail in Sunderland. While jobs are not – at this stage – apparently under threat at the car manufacturer’s plant in the city, the news comes as a blow. In the months after the 2016 referendum, Nissan said it would build the new car in the UK after receiving assurances from the government.
FEB3	If you want to make a successful product, size matters – perhaps even more than how well it works	Is it the end of the Airbus A380? That was the question my colleague Simon Calder asked in his column yesterday. The answer essentially is that this depends on Emirates, the principal customer for the super-jumbo. If it does not order more, Airbus may have to shut the line down. While the aircraft is extremely popular with passengers – if you have been on one you will recall how quiet it is – it is expensive to operate. It seems that people are not prepared to pay a premium for the experience.
FEB3	Trump has played straight into Putin’s hands by pulling out of the nuclear weapons treaty	In these dangerous times, Donald Trump has made an elementary error. By announcing that the United States will suspend the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, he has played into Vladimir Putin’s hands.  Instead of standing firm with America’s allies in Nato against Russian violations of the treaty, President Trump has decided to pull out of the agreement altogether in six months if Russia does not comply. This gave President Putin the excuse to announce today that Russia, too, will abandon the treaty.
FEB4	Kawczynski’s inept falsehoods are hilarious but it’s not a joke – this kind of thing is corroding British politics	It’s never the lie, it’s always the cover-up, and so, in fact, we must applaud Shrewsbury and Atcham MP Daniel Kawczynski’s inventive approach to having been caught so transparently red-handed. If you need the background, on Saturday Kawczynski claimed that, after the Second World War, there had been “no Marshall Plan for us, only for Germany”, referring to the vast grants given by the US to European nations to rebuild after the Second World War.
FEB4	Why it matters that 21 Savage is ICE's latest victim	The latest development in ICE’s (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) apparent single-minded quest to become the most hated arm of a deeply unpopular government came to a head in Atlanta, Georgia during the early hours of Sunday 3 February. That’s when Grammy-nominated rapper 21 Savage (born Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested in what ICE spokesman Bryan Cox called a “targeted operation” involving local and federal law enforcement, and placed into deportation proceedings in federal immigration court.  ICE alleges that the 26-year-old known as 21 Savage is a British citizen who entered the US legally in July 2005, when he was 12 years old, and then overstayed his visa. It essentially places him on the same level as the DREAMERs who arrived in the US as children, are being punished by this administration for circumstances they could not control, and are still fighting for the right to stay.
FEB4	Ocasio-Cortez should have looked into Corbyn’s past before their phone call – now she is stuck with the damage	It’s difficult to know who got the least out of the “lovely” phone conversation between Jeremy Corbyn, 69, and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29.  True, as a kind of long-distance political blind date it seemed to have got off to a promising start. As is the modern way – and no one can accuse our veteran leader of the opposition of being wedded to outdated ideas or sticking stubbornly to antique beliefs he took at dictation speed from Tony Benn in about 1975 – they both tweeted the happy news about their first, telephonic summit. 
FEB4	This is what the Yvette Cooper memes tell us about British politics today	It’s nearly three years since Jo Cox was murdered – by a man who gave his name in court as “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain” – and people are still putting the word “traitor” on the faces of female MPs that they don’t like.  This week, it was the turn of Yvette Cooper. I have collected 88 different memes posted since last week that use her name, picture or both. Some have been posted or shared thousands of times across Twitter, Facebook and Gab, in a kind of Cooper anti-fandom. It’s not OK.
FEB4	Turning Point UK and moderate pro-Brexit groups will change the party system – but not for the better	Could Brexit be about to break the mould of British politics? There are certainly many who would like it to be so. While some way away from registering a name and logo with the Electoral Commission, the establishment of a London office for the Trumpite Turning Point group is one sign that the radical neo-Thatcherite hard-Brexit wing of the Conservative Party is feeling increasingly attracted to a more exclusive, ideologically pure kind of political club.
FEB4	There is a link between our Brexit debacle and inadequate history lessons in school	Daniel McGrath makes a valid point in Saturday’s letters regarding Britain’s relationship to Germany in the 20th century. While it is important we remember the two world wars, without a wider knowledge and understanding of historical issues it is impossible to give national and international politics any context.  I would suggest Britain’s difficulty in interpreting its history and understanding it in the context of modern politics is not just as a result of the television programmes we watch. I consider myself lucky enough to have had a good education from a good state school, yet my history classes were dominated by learning about the two world wars and little else. Nothing was taught about our relationship with Ireland, Gibraltar or the development and workings of the EU. 
FEB4	If you're worried about Mary Poppins being racist, then you're focusing on the wrong thing	First of all, an admission. I've never seen Mary Poppins all the way through. While I know the chorus of Supercalifragilistic-et cetera off by heart – albeit not intentionally – jaunty chimney-sweeps and gaudy nannies just aren't my thing. (My son, however, has seen Mary Poppins multiple times – apparently never when I've been in the same room.)
FEB4	Unite’s Len McCluskey is supposed to champion workers’ rights – but the Nissan debacle shows he’s failing	While Unite boss Len McCluskey was busy politicking and undermining the united front the union movement had sought to present to Theresa May’s government over Brexit, a bomb was in the process of falling on his members. Those in Sunderland have been facing up to the harsh reality of the Tory project that Lexiters such as the Unite leader are playing the role of facilitators for.
FEB4	If Venezuela slides towards war – it's down to more than Trump’s know-nothing approach to world politics	Is Donald Trump about to launch a war against Venezuela? Judging from the president and his supporters’ recent rhetoric it appears that they are laying the ground for such a possibility. In a CBS interview on Sunday Trump said that sending US troops to crisis-ridden Venezuela is “an option”. He also affirmed that he had rejected a request from Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro for talks. Trump, his close supporters in the White House and now European leaders have recognised Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. This is despite the inauguration of Maduro for his second term as president on 10 January. The pretext is the grave crisis afflicting Venezuela, where around 3 million people have fled the country over the last four years, as a consequence of economic collapse and Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian tendencies.
FEB4	Forget how 'boring' Maroon 5’s Super Bowl show was – it was a missed opportunity to hold the NFL accountable	Last night, 100 million people watched as Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Big Boi took music’s biggest stage for the Super Bowl half-time show. Headlines skewered their performance, calling it at best “inessential,” and at worst “the worst ever.” But I wasn’t concerned about Adam Levine stripping off his shirt, or his awkward dancing next to Travis Scott. I was waiting for the band to take a knee. I started a Change.org petition asking Maroon 5 to boycott the NFL and drop out of the Super Bowl half-time show. When they confirmed and added Travis Scott and Big Boi to the bill, 115,000 people joined me in asking them to take a knee in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. In his only pre-show interview with ET, Adam Levine promised that those who kneel with Kaepernick would be heard.
FEB6	Trump’s erratic foreign policy has left him in a tight corner	Leaders facing serious domestic crises can try to distract public dissatisfaction by embarking on foreign adventures which can then be presented as a victory. It is a policy which can, at times, work very well. For Donald Trump, however, the scope for this is rather limited. The US president announced in the foreign policy section of his State of the Union address that he will hold another summit with Kim Jong-Un of North Korea. Talks are being held with the Taliban over Afghanistan. In Syria, he claimed Isis has been defeated under his command. Nearer home, he decried Nicolas Maduro’s government in Venezuela, putting the blame for the troubles there on leftist policies.
FEB6	Forget the cries of outrage about Howard Schultz — he should run as an independent, and here's why	In the city he made his home and where he transformed a local coffee chain into a global monster, there is a surprising amount of suspicion about Howard Schultz.  Yes, he grew up in poverty in New York, and yes, he provided decent wages to Starbucks’ employees. But in 2006, having bought the NBA’s Seattle SuperSonics team five years earlier, he sold it to a businessman from Oklahoma. The city has not had a professional basketball team since. Ask most people if they could ever trust this man after what he did, and you get a shake of the head.
FEB6	Palestinians have lost a wonderful friend in Jeremy Hardy	The entire team at Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) were immensely saddened to hear of the death of Jeremy Hardy last week. Jeremy made jokes about his height, but as one of our trustees declared when they heard the news, Jeremy was a moral giant. Always ready to challenge injustice with a perfect combination of compassion and mischievous wit, his support for the rights of Palestinians was unflagging. He revelled in the implausible extent of Palestinian hospitality, and could joke about the daily grind of the occupation without belittling the immense impact of its routine indignities.
FEB6	Migrants in France are only treated like humans if they can perform superhuman feats or save lives	A 20 year-old asylum seeker has received a wave of praise and support for rescuing a young woman who was being assaulted by another employee. Mamoud Diallo is currently working as a trainee cook in Autrans, an alpine region in the south east of France, but originally hails from Guinea. Following his brave intervention, the perpetrator was arrested by the police and the wheels were swiftly put in motion for a resolution to Diallo’s asylum claim to be reached. Having first arrived in 2018, Diallo now has an appointment with the France’s Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons on 19 February. Following this meeting, the department will decide whether to accept or reject his asylum application.
FEB6	Rise in hate crime is the product of our divisive age – social media giants must now step up to the plate	Hate crime takes many forms, and only in recent times has the language of hate begun to be afforded the same sort of consideration as physical violence or acts of discrimination, and encompassed all the groups – gender, disability, and race – who find themselves under attack.  The report of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime highlights what has been bleakly apparent for some time: hate crime is on the rise in Britain, and, in part, some of it can be attributed to the emotions stirred up by Brexit and the aftermath of the 2016 referendum. Or, rather, some of those leading the debate on Brexit have sent out entirely the wrong signals to their followers.
FEB6	Turning Point UK and moderate pro-Brexit groups will change the party system – but not for the better	Could Brexit be about to break the mould of British politics? There are certainly many who would like it to be so. While some way away from registering a name and logo with the Electoral Commission, the establishment of a London office for the Trumpite Turning Point group is one sign that the radical neo-Thatcherite hard-Brexit wing of the Conservative Party is feeling increasingly attracted to a more exclusive, ideologically pure kind of political club.
FEB6	Donald Tusk is a victim of Brexit – no wonder he wants to consign Brexiteers to a ‘special place in hell’	The burning question appears to be, “Why would Donald Tusk use such undiplomatic language at such an important and sensitive moment?” Why, the day before Theresa May comes to Brussels, and with time to find a Brexit deal now best measured in hours rather than days, would he stand on stage at a press conference, a matching tweet primed and ready to go, and say he has been “wondering what that special place in hell looks like, for those who promoted Brexit, without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely”.
FEB6	Donald Trump's State of the Union speech had so much promise — then it crashed and burnt in the most frightening way	 Halfway through, I thought I was going to have to concede that Donald Trump had made a good speech. Most of his policies and views remain abhorrent – that should go without saying – but they were couched in much more intelligent terms than any of his previous public addresses. He spoke impressively of the lowest unemployment rates of all time for African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans. He spoke of increased opportunity for people with disabilities. He introduced Elvin Hernandez, a legal immigrant from the Dominican Republic and now a special agent who works to reduce sex trafficking, and upheld him as an example of the American Dream. “Legal immigrants,” he said, “enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.”
FEB6	John Barnes is right – outrage over the Liam Neeson confession should give way to something more useful	I suspect neither the actor Liam Neeson nor the footballer John Barnes see themselves as social commentators and yet, this week, they have offered some of the most illuminating views on race relations. We are all bombarded with so many headlines every day that it’s convenient to quickly file them away in our minds according to stereotypes. Who’s got the time to carefully examine them all? We don’t have the time for nuance anymore, and frankly it is poisoning our public debate.
FEB6	Donald Tusk is a friend to Britain and our MPs should take heed	Donald Tusk, as president of the European Council – an essentially political body representing the EU’s member states – is quite entitled to use the sort of frank language he did when he remarked that there will be a “special place in hell” for politicians who promoted Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan”. Contrary to how some of the Brexiteers have reacted, Mr Tusk makes such remarks not because he is anti-British but because he is a friend of Britain, and does not wish to see the nation suffer by leaving the EU.
FEB7	Who does Donald Tusk think he is? We’ve always been so civil with these ‘EU dirty rats’	How dare Donald Tusk be rude about “those who promoted Brexit without a plan to carry it out?” Those who promoted Brexit have gone out of their way for 30 years to use polite language about Europe, always well-mannered with the highest standards of decorum, because we’re British. We’re not like these rude foreign mental cases with their shitty croissants. The Sun is especially annoyed, declaring: “Sneering Eurocrat Tusk’s tantrum shows a disregard for democracy.” You can see why the newspaper is upset, as it has always expressed its feelings towards the EU in such carefully crafted terms, with headlines such as “Up yours Delors” and “EU dirty rats”. If anything, The Sun is too polite – so polite its words can be compared to the dialogue in a BBC adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.
FEB7	I've researched people like Dan Mallory — and I think he's still playing with us	The New Yorker has exposed Dan Mallory (aka AJ Finn, superstar author of The Woman In The Window) as a cold-hearted conman who faked death, disease and doctorates for the purposes of self-promotion and personal gain this week.  Manipulating colleagues, fans and the publishing industry, Mallory claimed his mother died from cancer when he was in his teens; in fact, she is alive and well. So is his brother whom he said committed suicide. 
FEB7	The Turning Point saga shows how easily US money can infiltrate and influence British political discourse	The launch of Turning Point UK, the British chapter of the hugely wealthy right-wing American students organisation, was welcomed this weekend by Tory right wingers and, on social media, by a spate of satirical parody accounts. Since 2012, Turning Point has been a fixture of the American culture war over college campuses. Led by a friend of the Trump family, Charlie Kirk, Turning Point is a platform for anti-state, extreme free market ideas, which – like many new right-wing movements – has also flirted with “alt right” practices and ideas.
FEB7	Screen time is not the real problem for our phone-obsessed kids – it's where they end up	Into the seething pit of parental doubts about our children’s online lives, the UK chief medical officers (CMOs) have flung their guidance on young people’s screen use. Experts are rightly worried about the effects it can have on mental health, but cautious about laying blame in the wrong place. One of the central thoughts is that we simply don’t know how much screen time is too much. The evidence is not there to set the simple limit many parents crave. In short, the advice is that screen time shouldn’t override good things like sleep, sport and family time.
FEB7	Rise in hate crime is the product of our divisive age – social media giants must now step up to the plate	Hate crime takes many forms, and only in recent times has the language of hate begun to be afforded the same sort of consideration as physical violence or acts of discrimination, and encompassed all the groups – gender, disability, and race – who find themselves under attack.  The report of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hate Crime highlights what has been bleakly apparent for some time: hate crime is on the rise in Britain, and, in part, some of it can be attributed to the emotions stirred up by Brexit and the aftermath of the 2016 referendum. Or, rather, some of those leading the debate on Brexit have sent out entirely the wrong signals to their followers.
FEB7	Turning Point UK and moderate pro-Brexit groups will change the party system – but not for the better	Could Brexit be about to break the mould of British politics? There are certainly many who would like it to be so. While some way away from registering a name and logo with the Electoral Commission, the establishment of a London office for the Trumpite Turning Point group is one sign that the radical neo-Thatcherite hard-Brexit wing of the Conservative Party is feeling increasingly attracted to a more exclusive, ideologically pure kind of political club.
FEB7	Corbyn hardens policy of backing Brexit – and increases the chances of a split in the Labour Party	Jeremy Corbyn is still trying to hold the Labour coalition together on Brexit. He wrote to the prime minister last night, urging her to change her deal to include a permanent customs union with the EU to “win the support of parliament”. This was calculated to maintain his straddle between those in his party who want to stay in the EU and those who say the referendum must be respected.  The Labour MPs who want to stop Brexit reacted badly. They condemned Corbyn for facilitating “a deal which will make this country poorer” (Chuka Umunna), indulging “nativist nostalgia” (Owen Smith) and putting “Labour’s conference policy in the bin” (Chris Leslie). 
FEB7	In seventy short seconds, Theresa May confirmed she has lost all grip on reality	No press conference for Theresa May in Brussels. Perhaps because she had absolutely nothing new to say whatsoever, though that hasn’t stopped her at any point in the last six months. All we got were some short strangulated barks of nothing, lasting about a minute, delivered into a microphone held by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, to make clear, as only she can, that nothing has changed.
FEB7	Brexit has given Corbyn the ball and an open goal – but he still won’t take the shot	Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015 partly because his party had grown weary of pragmatism, and his brand of idealism made for a refreshing change. On Brexit, however, his idealism, if such it is, has reached ridiculous – and dangerous – proportions, because his policy is so unrealistic.
FEB7	Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit plan has betrayed younger Labour voters and they will not forgive him	As the Brexit negotiations stagger on, a large swathe of Labour voters will be bitterly disappointed this week by the party leadership. In particular, younger voters who flocked to the party in 2017 in the expectation that the party would fight this Tory disaster will feel they have been sold down the river. Worse still, many think Labour is complicit. Today, Richard Brooks, one of the co-founders of anti-Brexit youth group For our Future’s Sake, spelt out how young Labour voters feel: “The Liberal Democrats went onto campuses and promised young people to not increase tuition fees. When they trebled them, only months later, young people and students mobilised – and in 2015 the Liberal Democrats were all but wiped out. The Labour Party now has the same existential threat before it. Does it enable a Tory Brexit, which will disproportionately harm young and working-class people, or does Labour follow the wishes of hundreds of thousands of members like me, and support a people’s vote?” He is absolutely right.
FEB8	Trump says Isis has been defeated, but he is ignoring the bigger and much more worrying picture	President Trump says that in the coming week the US and its allies will announce that they have captured all of the land previously controlled by Isis. He claims that US-led forces “have liberated virtually all of the territory previously held by Isis in Syria and Iraq … we will have 100 per cent of the caliphate.“  The prediction has sparked a sterile and misleading debate about whether or not Isis is finally defeated, something which will remain unproven since the movement is unlikely to run up a white flag and sign terms of surrender. The discussion has – like all debates about foreign policy in the US – very little to do with the real situation on the ground in Syria and Iraq and everything to do with the forces at play in Washington politics. 
FEB8	Some advice for Virginia Governor Ralph Northam: how to apologise like you actually mean it	These two words may seem simple, but the ability to express them when you’re in the wrong is anything but – particularly for those in the public eye. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, to name a recent example, was forced to apologise after his 1984 medical school yearbook page resurfaced showing two unnamed men, one with blackface and another wearing the Ku Klux Klan’s white hood and robe. That he seriously botched his effort to apologize is arguably one of the reasons many people are still calling on him to resign.
FEB8	The fight against sexual harassment on campus began in 1977. The Warwick rape threats show little has changed	For so many women, sexual harassment, assault and rape are a painfully familiar component of life at university. So when screenshots from a Warwick University student Facebook chat entitled “F*** Women, Disrespect them all” were shared online last year, the content was deeply shocking but sadly not surprising. Equally unsurprising was the utter inadequacy of the university’s response. In the chat, a group of male students shared ableist, racist and homophobic comments and traded some of the most abhorrent rape threats imaginable. These threats were made about specific women at the university, women they knew and had befriended.
FEB8	Instagram finally acts – but the state should now be given the power to take on the biggest firms on earth	After a global backlash in the wake of Molly Russell’s tragic death, Instagram has finally, reluctantly done the right thing and agreed to wipe awful images of self harm from our children’s’ screens. It’s about time. How did it come to this? This was not Instagram’s first offence, and it is now clearer than ever – this government’s soft-touch approach to the internet has to end.
FEB8	France and Italy's rising tensions are as ‘high as WWII’ – should we be worried?	Roberto Salvini, the Italian deputy minister, has advised the French to get rid of their “terrible leader” Emmanuel Macron, and apparently throws darts at a picture of the French president. Macron has described right-wing populism of the Rome government as a kind of “leprosy” spreading across Europe. Italy has even threatened to stop a loan of Leonardo da Vinci’s works for a show in Paris at the Louvre. France has now recalled its ambassador to Rome in protest at antagonism it says has reached the level of the Second World War.  All this, one may say, puts the view of Donald Tusk that irresponsible Brexiting politicians deserve a special place in hell into perspective. The UK leaving the European Union may resemble the various long retreats from Moscow at the end of failed campaigns; but the real diplomatic warfare threatened in Europe is now between France and Italy.
FEB8	Mea Culpa: warp factor one in the State of the Union address	Donald Trump in his State of the Union address announced another summit with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. In a comment article, our correspondent was unimpressed: “This had been well trailed and expected; and it is the second one – the novelty factor of the first meeting is no longer there.” Nothing wrong with that, except that “factor” is a dead word. It is often used as a way of avoiding the prosaic “thing”, in what I think is the mistaken belief that it sounds more intellectual to write, for example, about “another factor to be considered”. But here it could just disappear and the sentence would read better. 
FEB8	The real story about Jeff Bezos and the National Enquirer could be much more intriguing than it already is	Jeff Bezos (usually dubbed “the world’s richest man” in any first sentence) is at war with the National Enquirer. The Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post yesterday published a blogpost in which he described how he had received an email, apparently from representatives of American Media Inc (AMI, the parent company of the Enquirer), threatening to publish “intimate photos” of him and his partner, Lauren Sanchez.
FEB8	Christopher Chope MP says anti-FGM legislation hasn't had ‘proper scrutiny’. His rubbish bears no scrutiny at all	The first and most important point to begin with about Christopher Chope is that the boilerplate defence of Christopher Chope, as used by Christopher Chope on the regular occasion Christopher Chope embarrasses himself in public, is that it is fundamentally untrue. Today, he rose in the House of Commons to object to an anti-female genital mutilation bill, just as he rose last year to throw out a proposed ban on upskirting.
FEB8	Bullying smaller countries into taking trade deals is not the Brexit panacea we were promised	If Britain does ever leave the European Union with no deal, by accident or by design, then it will have at least some countries it can do business with. With only a few weeks to the putative Brexit day of 29 March, and with well over two years of preparatory work behind it, the Department for International Trade has managed to secure a mere three out of the 40 agreements the UK enjoys through EU membership, which cover 71 countries. 
FEB8	Antisemitism never went away – it’s just that now MPs like Luciana Berger are standing up to it	As the Labour Party once more finds itself engulfed in bitter recriminations about the extent of antisemitism within its ranks, a 95-year-old Jewish woman who survived Auschwitz met with a 79-year-old man, the son of the Nazi governor general of Poland, to talk about antisemitism, then and now. The woman, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch was a co-founder of the English Chamber Orchestra; she survived (not just Auschwitz but Belsen as well) because, even at the age of 18, she was an accomplished cellist and so was recruited to the notorious Auschwitz orchestra. The man was Niklas Frank, a former German journalist, who has devoted his life to campaigning against antisemitism and who has described his father as “the butcher of Poland”.
FEB9	Despite his vast privilege and the allegations against him, Philip Green is bafflingly trying to paint himself as a victim	Philip Green must have thought the worst was behind him when he decided to drop the injunction granted against The Daily Telegraph publishing a story about his shocking behaviour towards his employees.  But new allegations now suggest Green groped a woman, calling her a “naughty girl” and then paid her £1m to stay quiet. He also allegedly mocked a black employee’s dreadlocks and suggested that Arcadia needed to be “careful about hiring” as there are “too many black people” working in his business. These are just a few of the incidents reported.
FEB9	Christopher Chope's objection to FGM laws is a cruel affront to survivors like me	The earliest law that was put in place to tackle FGM in the UK was the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, which was replaced by the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. 34 years later, on 1 February 2019, the UK had its first successful prosecution and many survivors, activists and those in government, reacted with a curious mix of joy and pain. Pain because it reminded us that we had all failed a three-year-old girl, given the prosecution of her mother will never give back her full agency or a life without pain, confusion and sadness; and joy because it seemed finally as if the severity of this issue was being taken seriously and the slow arm of justice had finally come into force.   
FEB9	If MPs want to fix the system, they should find an alternative to the two main parties	In his letter yesterday Gavin Turner asks why Chuka Umunna and his like-minded Labour Party members, along with Tory Remainers, don’t leave their parties. It seems to me the issue lies within our broken two-party system. Different factions of both of the main parties have wildly different ideals and beliefs. However, they would rather fight for control within, because success doing so guarantees power. If they followed their ideals, we would have at least two parties formed from within the Conservatives and two from within Labour. We are only in this mess because David Cameron decided to tackle his internal issue with the Brexit referendum.
FEB9	It'll take more to tackle young people's mental health issues than just banning images on Instagram	It was a reassuring to see a quick response from Instagram and Facebook in acting responsibly to remove dangerous images of self-harm from their platforms. These are images that can, beyond doubt, have a severely negative impact on a person’s mental health. Although I applaud government for taking on the issue, I can’t help but feel that the approach in pointing the blame at social media, while ignoring the responsibility for the failure that falls on its own shoulders, is a bit like throwing a bucket of water into a burning building, while clutching onto the matches that sparked the flames.
FEB9	Foie gras is a cruel and inhumane product – now Brexit finally offers us the opportunity to ban it	Is anyone really still eating the diseased livers of tormented birds? As people all over the world are pushing for bans on the production and sale of foie gras, it seems the days of this disgusting “torture in a tin” are numbered. Good riddance to vile rubbish, I say! Foie gras production is so barbaric that it is illegal in the UK – as well as in most parts of Europe. As such, it has the dubious distinction of being one of the few “ingredients” that Brits are banned from making but, paradoxically, permitted to sell, buy, and consume. Across the pond this week, New York officials proposed legislation to ban the sale of foie gras on the grounds of cruelty to animals. Absurdly, if this bill passes, it’ll still be legal to force-feed geese and ducks for the fatty liver within city limits, but the banned pate will have to be sold elsewhere.
FEB9	The Top 10: back-formations	I came across the first four of these in Rebecca Gowers’s book Horrible Words, which, despite its title, is a wonderful book.  1. Greed came from greedy, which preceded it by 600 years. Similarly, laze came from lazy.
FEB9	Some advice for Virginia Governor Ralph Northam: how to apologise like you actually mean it	These two words may seem simple, but the ability to express them when you’re in the wrong is anything but – particularly for those in the public eye. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, to name a recent example, was forced to apologise after his 1984 medical school yearbook page resurfaced showing two unnamed men, one with blackface and another wearing the Ku Klux Klan’s white hood and robe. That he seriously botched his effort to apologize is arguably one of the reasons many people are still calling on him to resign.
FEB9	Political tensions throughout Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdown	The European economy is stuck, and this has nothing to do with Brexit. Try this question: out of the four largest European economies – Germany, the UK, France and Italy – which grew fastest in the second half of last year? The answer is almost certainly the UK. We don’t have the final figures yet for all the countries, but we know that Italy was in recession, with the economy having shrunk in both quarters. Germany shrank in the third quarter, and economists expect it to have grown very slowly, if at all, in the fourth. France grew by 0.3 per cent in each quarter. And the UK grew by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter and is expected to have grown by about 0.3 per cent in the final three months – we get figures this coming week.
FEB9	Jeremy Corbyn takes two steps forward and only one step back in tackling antisemitism	It has been a mixed week for the Labour leader. Having reversed his counterproductive decision to refuse to meet the prime minister to discuss Brexit, he took the initiative with a proposal for a closer economic relationship with the European Union after Britain leaves – a plan that was welcomed by Donald Tusk and that put Theresa May under pressure from the soft-Brexit wing of her own party.  Naturally, Jeremy Corbyn’s demand for a permanent customs union did not go down well with The Independent, or with Labour MPs who support our campaign for a Final Say referendum, because it seemed to confirm that he wants to leave the EU without going back to the people – hence his back-pedalling in a speech in Coventry today, saying Labour could still back a new referendum.  
FEB9	Bullying smaller countries into taking trade deals is not the Brexit panacea we were promised	If Britain does ever leave the European Union with no deal, by accident or by design, then it will have at least some countries it can do business with. With only a few weeks to the putative Brexit day of 29 March, and with well over two years of preparatory work behind it, the Department for International Trade has managed to secure a mere three out of the 40 agreements the UK enjoys through EU membership, which cover 71 countries. 
FEB10	I refuse to leave the EU, so I’ve asked every country to adopt me as a 'second citizen'	What is your personal response to being European? I got an intriguing invite from the National Theatre of Scotland last year to create a performance, Second Citizen, which explores just what that question means to me. The first thing that I could think was that I simply refuse to stop being European. Second Citizen will be one of six performances staged as part of Dear Europe, an evening of artistic responses, in Glasgow on 29 March – the proposed date for Britain’s exit from the European Union. Who knows quite what political drama will unfold on that day? Our event, however, is set in stone.
FEB10	MPs should approve Theresa May’s deal on one condition – a new referendum	We represent completely different constituencies. Hove and Portslade on the south coast voted 70 per cent Remain in the 2016 EU referendum. In Sedgefield, in County Durham, the result was 60 per cent Leave. One a seaside resort; the other a former coal mining but still a heavily industrial area. One a marginal seat; the other steeped in the Labour tradition. Where we represent is also our home and we care deeply about the prospects of those around us.  For us to continue to promote the interests of our constituents, it is obvious to us we must move beyond the Brexit paralysis engulfing parliament and our country. The pursuit of compromise is now the top priority if we are to retain the integrity of our parliamentary democracy and unblock the Brexit log jam. If we do not achieve this, Brexit will continue to numb our senses to all else because to say “just get on with it” isn’t enough.
FEB10	I’ve witnessed the aftermath of the unrest in Zimbabwe – the law is failing the country’s citizens	After widespread unrest between 14-16 January, following a hike in fuel prices across Zimbabwe, over a thousand people have been arrested, a number of those in apparent “dragnet” operations by both police and the army. What happened immediately thereafter appeared to be a wholesale breakdown in proper legal process. Magistrates’ courts separately but almost universally made decisions to deny bail whatever the circumstances – indeed, even where urgent medical attention was required.  Prosecutions were then “fast-tracked”, occasionally without any legal representation. Even where there was representation there was inadequate time and facilities to prepare, let alone present, a proper defence. Although expressly denied, in light of the fact that decisions on bail and subsequent pressure to immediately proceed with trials was so consistent and widespread, it’s hard not to conclude that there was some central pressure and co-ordination. We were told of a trial commencing with a defendant in agony from bullet wounds.
FEB10	If MPs want to fix the system, they should find an alternative to the two main parties	In his letter yesterday Gavin Turner asks why Chuka Umunna and his like-minded Labour Party members, along with Tory Remainers, don’t leave their parties. It seems to me the issue lies within our broken two-party system. Different factions of both of the main parties have wildly different ideals and beliefs.

It’s about time. How did it come to this? This was not Instagram’s first offence, and it is now clearer than ever – this government’s soft-touch approach to the internet has to end.

As people all over the world are pushing for bans on the production and sale of foie gras, it seems the days of this disgusting “torture in a tin” are numbered. Good riddance to vile rubbish, I say! Foie gras production is so barbaric that it is illegal in the UK – as well as in most parts of Europe.

These are just a few of the incidents reported.
FEB10	Social media was my escape as a teenager – now it’s morphed into something terrifying	When I think back to my days in secondary school, one incident in particular sticks out. It was just after break and there was a table. It had no screws in it. Someone told me to go and sit on it, and silly me did. Predictably, the table collapsed and everybody laughed.
FEB10	Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential bid announcement has rattled Donald Trump – and the pressure will only mount from here	There’s nothing like getting your excuses in early. Or, if you’re Donald Trump, the insults too. Having claimed, absurdly, that the Democrats “cannot legitimately win” the 2020 presidential election, the president has now repeated offensive remarks about Elizabeth Warren’s Native American ancestry, and seemingly made a thinly veiled joke about the Trail of Tears – a series of forced relocations of Native Americans in the 1800s, regarded by many as a genocide.
FEB10	Don’t criticise Sir Christopher Chope for blocking the anti-FGM bill – there are faster ways to tackle this awful crime	Sir Christopher Chope was right to object to the private members’ bill concerning female genital mutilation. Bills that concern people’s liberty and, as in this case, the custody of their children should be given the fullest debate and the most careful line by line consideration, which usually can only happen when they are backed by the government. FGM has been illegal throughout the UK since 1985, and yet we had had to wait till 2015 for the first prosecution and until this year for the first conviction. By contrast France has managed over a hundred successful prosecutions during the past 30 years. The clear inference from this is that Britain lacks the will to tackle this problem.
FEB11	Williamson’s military manoeuvres can’t make up for Britain’s weak hand post-Brexit	Sending an aircraft carrier into disputed waters of the China Seas in a display of “hard power”, a part of this country’s military strategy in the post-Brexit world, may seem to resonate with imperial hubris and echoes of Pax Britannica.    And the language used by defence secretary Gavin Williamson in announcing the deployment was indeed full of reference to past challenges, fortitude and triumphs – evoking the Raj and the “Great Game”, the Second World War, Churchill and the “darkest hours”, and “east of Suez”.
FEB11	Finally, a load of leftie Democrats are standing for president. Unfortunately, it probably won't work out the way they want	The field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates continues to grow and as it does, the opportunity for the prospects to differentiate themselves from the field shrinks. With 10 declared candidates already — and at least three more likely announcements from Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke — Democrats will have a large swathe of major candidates vying for a pool of delegates to get the nomination and face off against Donald Trump.
FEB11	My conservative case against Trump's border wall makes sense — even if you don't like that I'm a liberal	The immense political divide in the US gnaws at me. Call me naïve, but I believe that at our core, most of us want the same or similar things. We simply disagree on how to best achieve them. If only we could find common ground, I tell myself, we could actually come up with solutions that satisfy both sides of the aisle. So when a Facebook friend challenged “liberals” like me to make a case “not based on emotion” on why we oppose Trump’s border wall, I decided to use conservative sources to back up my arguments.
FEB11	Dominique Ray died alone on death row — if he hadn't been a Muslim, it would never have happened	Late at night on 7 February, Dominique Ray was executed in the death chamber by the State of Alabama. He died alone. The killing by the state of another African American man in the death belt of the American South would not have usually drawn significant attention. But Dominique Ray was different. He died alone because he was Muslim. Had he been Christian, Alabama would have provided a state-employed Christian chaplain to give him comfort, hold his hand and prepare him for death in his final moments.
FEB11	I introduced GCSEs in the 1980s – but now it’s time to scrap them	As secretary of state for education during the late 1980s, I was responsible for the introduction of the national curriculum and with it the GCSE exams. It made absolute sense at that point, bringing together and consolidating separate tests to mark what, at the time, meant the end of their time in education for many young people. Times have changed.
FEB11	It’s all well and good naming a boat after Alan Kurdi – but it means nothing if the world no longer cares	It is nearly three and half years since the death of Alan Kurdi, the little Syrian refugee whose body was washed up on a Turkish beach. Kurdi – and the photographs of his corpse, being gently washed by the waters of Aegean – became an emblem of the refugee crisis that was enveloping Europe. He could have been anybody’s child: for a short time he was everybody’s.
FEB11	The devil wears parkas? A (limited) defence of Amy Klobuchar	Senator Amy Klobuchar’s public persona as the warm and personable “senator next door” (as she titled her book) took a big hit Wednesday, days before she announced her 2020 run for the presidency. Far from the pop-culturally iconic “Minnesota nice” Marge Gunderson in Fargo — Frances McDormand’s relentlessly intelligent and supremely decent character—reporting from the Huffington Post sourced to multiple staffers painted Klobuchar as something more like Meryl Streep’s Miranda Priestly, the raging nightmare boss in The Devil Wears Prada. Reports depict an office environment in which the senator regularly and publicly berates staffers for work that fails to meet her standards, one in which employees regularly cry and regularly quit, and one in which, Buzzfeed has it, she even throws office supplies in moments of extreme anger. One errant flung binder apparently even struck an aide. She’d copy unrelated colleagues on unnecessarily critical emails calling work “the worst” she’d ever seen to shame people in a public way, the articles continue. She’d yell often.
FEB11	Amber Rudd’s admission about universal credit and food bank use has come much too late	Finally, a government minister has acknowledged an uncomfortable truth that everybody outside the government took as a given long ago – that the explosion in the use of food banks in recent years is in large part a consequence of failings in the rollout of universal credit. Amber Rudd, who took over at the Department for Work and Pensions in November, told MPs today that delays in universal credit payments being processed meant that claimants may have “had difficulty accessing their money early” and therefore could not afford to buy food. Perhaps Rudd has learnt her lesson about making sure the House of Commons isn’t misled.
FEB11	Gilets jaunes infighting shows the movement is brutally disunited – but Macron is still no match for them	Those of us who observed France’s gilets jaunes (yellow vests) on their 13th Saturday in a row of Paris street demonstrations last weekend witnessed incidents that were as surreal as they were horrific.  
FEB11	Cutting Britain’s aid budget would be a damning legacy for our government – here’s why	Slashing the aid budget, as this report suggests, would have a shattering effect on the world’s most vulnerable children and their families. Every single year, at least 60,000 fewer lives would be saved by immunisation, and at least 1 million more children would be out of school. This would be a damning legacy for a government that speaks of a “global Britain”.
FEB12	If Trump and his friends seriously cared about antisemitism, Ilhan Omar wouldn't be their priority	Imagine a serious reckoning with antisemitism in American politics. Fox News would stop inviting Sebastian Gorka, the Nazi-affiliated former aide to President Donald Trump, to appear on TV. Republicans would ask serious questions of house minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Remember when he warned Jewish billionaires would “buy” the upcoming election?
FEB12	Thank you, Joe Root – you have just made the lives of thousands of gay teenagers immeasurably better	We’ve all experienced it. That moment someone cuts you down, in jest or in spite, and it’s only some time afterwards that you consider how better you might have handled your response. From the workplace to the sports field, it’s a challenge in any situation of heightened tension to have the right clarity of thought to respond appropriately. Joe Root’s actions in St Lucia demonstrated how to affect a brilliant, calm and direct response to Shannon Gabriel after it’s alleged, he used homophobic language to put the England cricket captain off his stride as he built towards his sixteenth Test century.
FEB12	Why shows like Channel 4’s ‘Making of Me’ need to include more non-binary representations of trans identities	As we have seen with television programming over the past two years, trans identities and our “journey’s” apparently make great viewing. From Genderquake, arguably the elephant in the room in terms of Channel 4’s more progressive coverage of the trans community, to Trans Kids: It’s time to talk, which seemed poorly timed due to it's previous poor programming of trans people, we have been in the front rooms of millions of adoring cisgender people since what seems like forever.
FEB12	Joe Root’s response to homophobia was not heroic – it only shows how low our expectations are	I am going to get this out of the way and say I am grateful to Joe Root for his simple, swift and to the point retort to an alleged homophobic “sledging”. I could write an article on “sledging” and “banter” and all the other ways sport actively encourages language that minimises and obfuscates abuse.
FEB12	Spain’s trial of Catalan separatists is worse than an outrage – it is a terrible mistake	The Spanish government’s handling of the Catalonian independence movement is worse than a human rights outrage; it is a mistake.  The trial of a dozen separatist leaders on charges including “rebellion” and “sedition”, charges carrying sentences of up to 25 years in prison, ought to be unthinkable in country that is an established member of the European Union and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
FEB12	Trade concerns are looming all over the world – but all eyes remain on a post-Brexit deal	The European economy has pretty much ground to a halt – and this has very little to do with Brexit. If, however, the Brexit negotiations go badly, then the sky darkens – and not just across Europe. We have just had some poor figures for the UK in the final quarter of the year. The particularly shocking element was that the economy seems to have shrunk in December. If that is right, and those of us who have been around for a while know that these figures are often wrong, it would suggest that there has indeed been a sharp deterioration over the Christmas season.
FEB12	Trump's MAGA fans believe they're fighting for an American revolution. That's why we saw violence in El Paso	“F**k the media,” the man in the red Make America Great Again hat screamed. Moments before, he’d violently attacked a BBC cameraman who stood quietly filming the president’s speech last night in El Paso, jumping onto a press platform and shoving him wildly. In the minutes leading up to the attack, Trump had, as his audience no doubt now expects, lambasted the media. Pointing to where they stood, he proclaimed: “There they are”, to right-on-cue boos from the crowd. 
FEB12	Theresa May shows Brexit is nothing like Groundhog Day – it is a waste of time with no happy ending	We are, I fear, at the point of Brexit where if Theresa May seriously wants people to believe she hasn’t been dead for months she’s going to have to begin her “updates” by holding a copy of today’s newspaper in front of her face. Because it’s February 2019 now, fully two months since she cancelled her “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal, saying she would have to go and negotiate changes to the backstop. And here she was again, on her feet in the House of Commons, for approximately the eight hundredth time, breezily spelling out how she was busy “negotiating changes to the backstop”, and that she’d just need a little bit more time, if possible, to go to Brussels and negotiate some more changes to the backstop.
FEB12	When Trump fans assault journalists, should the press reassess its abusive relationship with the president?	The press pays attention to powerful people. Donald Trump began to capitalise on this in the 1980s, and arguably would never have become president if he wasn’t already a media personality. Now he likes to bites the hand that fed him, and his supporters have got the message too. Major political figures have always had a symbiotic relationship with the press. After a Trump fan in El Paso attacked a BBC cameraman last night, we have the confirmation that the president has become an abusive partner
FEB12	Drop your customs union red lines, Theresa May – Brexit voters don’t care about international trade deals	I have had many discussions with people who voted to leave the EU both in the lead-up to the referendum and since. At no time has the ability to conduct our own trade deals ever featured. There is a section of the Tory party that believes this is a key issue but I have not heard any convincing argument that this is so. In fact there is much evidence to the contrary.
FEB13	Being an American in London has taught me that US politics needs a good dose of British cynicism	On the first week of my study-abroad trip to London, my friends and I walked into a pub in Camden. “The Trump girls!” the bouncer shouted enthusiastically as we handed her our American IDs.
FEB13	As a blind actor and comedian, I believe able-bodied actors should be allowed to tell our stories too	As you may be aware, the very famous and able-bodied actor Bryan Cranston, of the hugely successful phenomenon that was Breaking Bad, has taken on the role of a disabled man for his recently released feature film, The Upside, and in doing so has stirred up an ongoing controversy: should able bodied actors really be taking on roles of disabled characters, or should such roles only be awarded to disabled actors?   I am blind. I am also a stand-up comedian and actor who has benefited from the desire of a very small number of writers, producers and directors, to not only increase the on screen visibility of characters with disabilities, but also to authentically cast disabled actors in these roles.  Basically, I've played a few blind guys on the telly and I am grateful for those opportunities.
FEB13	It's not Trump who the Democrats have to fear in the 2020 fight over healthcare — it's big pharma	For the second consecutive presidential election cycle, the question of whether to retain the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) or scrap it in favor of something else entirely threatens to take centre-stage. Unlike in 2016, however, which pitted Hillary Clinton’s pro-Obamacare stance against Donald Trump’s “repeal and replace” campaign pledge, and prior to that saw Hillary and Bernie Sanders engage in heated debate over what a progressive vision for healthcare in America should look like in the future, the 2020 version of this debate will bring on insurers, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other healthcare professionals as main participants.
FEB13	The government should proceed with caution when it comes to cannabis	New research has reopened the question of the harm caused by cannabis. A study in a journal published by the American Medical Association suggests 60,000 cases of depression in the UK could be caused by teenage use of marijuana.  This reinforces The Independent’s unfashionable caution about legalising soft drugs. While we welcomed Sajid Javid’s decision as home secretary to review the law on the medical use of cannabis, we warned about its association with mental illness. We argued that more research is needed before Britain presses ahead with the wider legalisation of the drug.
FEB13	Why ‘dump him’ is the feminist phrase we should all consider this Valentine's Day	When Britney Spears sported her infamous “dump him” shirt in 2002, she probably didn’t envisage the knock-off versions that would flood the internet for the almost two decades that followed. Back then, the break-up of the singer and Justin Timberlake was on the front page of every reputable tabloid. Granted, the shirt may have simply been a ploy to throw shade at Timberlake while simultaneously buying herself more time in the limelight, but despite Britney’s dubious intentions, the slogan became the poster child for a feminist movement we should all at least consider taking on board.
FEB13	Trade concerns are looming all over the world – but all eyes remain on a post-Brexit deal	The European economy has pretty much ground to a halt – and this has very little to do with Brexit. If, however, the Brexit negotiations go badly, then the sky darkens – and not just across Europe. We have just had some poor figures for the UK in the final quarter of the year. The particularly shocking element was that the economy seems to have shrunk in December. If that is right, and those of us who have been around for a while know that these figures are often wrong, it would suggest that there has indeed been a sharp deterioration over the Christmas season.
FEB13	The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government bewitched by Brexit	The latest story that would be front-page news if not for Brexit is the crisis in policing. A Police Federation survey today finds that 90 per cent of officers think the service is understaffed and that 44 per cent find the job very or extremely stressful, up from 39 per cent three years ago. The reduction in police numbers means that officers increasingly have to work alone, which is one of the big causes of stress. This matters to people. During the last election campaign, when politicians had to pay attention to what the voters care about, Jeremy Corbyn made Theresa May pay a price for police cuts in lost votes.
FEB13	Trump's MAGA fans believe they're fighting for an American revolution. That's why we saw violence in El Paso	“F**k the media,” the man in the red Make America Great Again hat screamed. Moments before, he’d violently attacked a BBC cameraman who stood quietly filming the president’s speech last night in El Paso, jumping onto a press platform and shoving him wildly. In the minutes leading up to the attack, Trump had, as his audience no doubt now expects, lambasted the media. Pointing to where they stood, he proclaimed: “There they are”, to right-on-cue boos from the crowd. 
FEB13	The Brexit ferry contract isn’t Chris Grayling’s only recent display of poor judgement – remember the northern rail U-turn?	A lot of coverage has been given to the fiasco of the proposed ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend. But another recent decision of Grayling’s has not received much attention in the press. In the north of England, his decision to downgrade the proposals for upgrading the TransPennine rail link was greeted with derision and incredulity. The original proposal (leaving aside HS3) was to electrify the whole route from Manchester to Leeds via Huddersfield, and to include enlargement of one of the Standedge tunnels so that container trains could use the route.
FEB13	Gucci and Katy Perry's ‘blackface’ designs are a symptom of overwhelming whiteness in the fashion industry	Just over a year ago, Swedish retailer H&M was forced to apologise after a promotional image showed a black child wearing a t-shirt with the slogan: “coolest monkey in the jungle”. At the time, this error was almost unbelievable, causing many to accuse the fashion giant of racism. In recent months, there have been several instances of fashion brands offending the black community with clothing that panders to offensive and, in my view, racist imagery. Last week, Italian fashion powerhouses Gucci stopped selling a “balaclava knit” that featured a roll neck design that was criticised for resembling blackface. Just days later, singer Katy Perry has been forced to apologise after a pair of shoes from her latest range drew similar comparisons.
FEB14	Calling a national emergency is the most selfish thing Donald Trump has ever done	It seemed for a brief second that Trump had been able to reach a compromise with the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. The fact that he had to sign off a bill in the Senate that would avert another highly unpopular government shutdown meant he could have blamed the failure to deliver his Mexican border wall on the Democrats and still retained some credibility with his MAGA fans. Because this was never really about a wall or immigration. It was a stunt pulled straight from reality TV to keep ratings high. “Trump’s presidency is the real national emergency,” wrote Representative Ruben Gallego on Twitter, and as well as expressing a sentiment that many an American would agree with, also drew attention to an important fact. There is no universally agreed-upon definition of a national emergency in any part of the US political system. This means that the president has the option to declare one when he or she (well, let’s face it, he) sees fit, according to his own judgement and discretion. George W Bush declared a national emergency in the days following 9/11, for example.
FEB14	Theresa May loses another battle – but she may be zigzagging towards winning the Brexit war	Theresa May has suffered another embarrassing Brexit defeat in the House of Commons, and given Jeremy Corbyn the chance to taunt her for running away from the chamber before the result was announced.  The Labour leader was justified in suggesting the prime minister’s approach to leaving the European Union was incoherent. She is zigzagging between appeasing the Eurosceptic wing of her party and trying to keep her soft-Brexit ministers from resigning. 
FEB14	The main change since Parkland? Traumatising active shooter drills in American schools — supported by the NRA	Today marks the first anniversary of the Parkland shooting, when 34 people were shot at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida; 17 students and staff members died. Former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and has yet to be tried. In the aftermath of the shooting, a lot was promised and little, ultimately, was done. In fact, one of the main things to be done had nothing to do with access to guns or assault weapons. Instead, it had to do with what happens in our schools: active shooter drills became much more prevalent across the US, and I have seen firsthand the effect that this has on our children.
FEB14	Valentine’s Day marks one of the bloodiest massacres in US history. We can't just blame the shooter	Today America will celebrate a tradition of love. Restaurants will be fully booked; movie theatres will be bustling; fresh flowers and foreign chocolates will sit on countertops, waiting to surprise millions of people, each of them considered someone’s most special person.  Many teenagers will use the day to send some of their very first love letters, purchasing roses in school lobbies across the country and writing messages to anonymously send to their first crushes, best friends or significant others. 
FEB14	What do we do about teenagers’ mental health if cannabis is legalised?	My son suffers from depression, and he uses cannabis. Throughout his treatment, mental health services have said that the strength of the cannabis is having a massive impact on the mental health of users. They have described what they refer to as a “mental health explosion” waiting to happen among teens. Among my son’s friends I am aware of three who are receiving help from mental health services. All smoke cannabis. This would represent a much higher percentage of teenagers who smoke cannabis than mentioned in your article. According to my son ALL of his friends smoke cannabis. And he has lots of friends.  I try to maintain a dialogue with my son about cannabis, even though I am often accused of being too old to understand! What I have learned from my conversations with him is the proliferation of forums/chatrooms online that seem to refute any and all arguments regarding the harm that cannabis can cause. According to many, all of the non-users should be made to smoke cannabis, and then all would be right with the world!
FEB14	Most ‘Isis brides’ I met in Syria showed signs of regret, even shame. Shamima Begum is different	They climbed down from the trucks in a cloud of dust. More than 1,000 women and children had just left the last few square miles of Isis-held territory, broken and exhausted from fleeing the last battle. Waiting for them at the screening point in the Syrian desert last month were stern-looking Kurdish intelligence officials and US special forces soldiers. As far as they were concerned, these families who had stayed in the caliphate until its dying days were willing supporters of Isis.
FEB14	Theresa May didn’t even turn up to be told of her own uselessness, and who can blame her?	Sibelius’s Concerto in D minor is widely considered the most virtuosic piece for solo violin. And if you can imagine 650 MPs reaching in perfect unison the apex of its final soaring crescendo at the precise moment Rome is hit by a nuclear bomb then you might have some idea where we currently are with Brexit. It is extraordinary, really, to think that the great nation of the United States of America requires a mere three amendments to guarantee freedom of speech, a fair judiciary and the right to shoot up your local high school if people have said mean things about you on Facebook. And yet over here, we’re on our ten thousandth Brexit amendment now and have made absolutely no progress whatsoever.
FEB14	Shamima Begum offers Britain a chance to show both the steel and compassion in our justice system	Shamima Begum is hardly an ideal poster girl for liberal values. According to a newspaper interview, and with no attempt to sensationalise, she appears to be still sympathetic to the so-called Islamic State “caliphate”, expresses little if any remorse about her activities, and, as far the media is concerned, expresses the opinion that journalists can be “enemies of the caliphate”. In the four years since she and two other school friends took the opportunity of a half-term break to make the journey from Bethnal Green to join a medieval death cult in the Middle East, much has happened to them. One apparently died in a bombing, and the whereabouts of the other is unknown. Ms Begum got married, lost two children to malnutrition and disease. Her first sight of a severed head in a bin, she says, “didn’t faze me at all”.
FEB14	The trouble with Winston Churchill is that he was a hero partly because he was such a daft racist	As the country is experiencing a period of tranquillity, with nothing of importance likely to happen in the next few months, there has been an opportunity to calmly discuss John McDonnell’s comment that Winston Churchill was a “villain”. So all day there were commentators making statements such as “Maybe Churchill was racist, but I for one wish I could have been black in 1920, just so I could have had the honour of being racially abused by the greatest man that ever lived.”
FEB14	It's a privilege to say you hate Valentine's Day — remember that	Fewer Americans are celebrating Valentine’s Day this year. Spending might be at an all-time-high, but only 51 per cent of adults will actually mark the day, lower than any year for at least a decade.
FEB15	Yes, Shamima Begum has made mistakes – but it’s time for this misguided teenager to return home	Two teenage girls whose lives have been driven by their beliefs made headline news this week. One sits stateless and heavily pregnant in a squalid refugee camp in Northern Syria, begging to come back to Britain. The other young woman refuses to attend school on Fridays and stages a weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament, holding a placard reading “School Strike for the Climate”. Greta Thunberg’s campaign to force adults to stop prevaricating and act to save the planet has inspired thousands of like-minded young people. School strikes on Fridays have taken place in Belgium, Australia, Switzerland and the USA – and this week, Great Britain. Events culminate on 15 March with a global protest.
FEB15	Calling a national emergency is the most selfish thing Donald Trump has ever done	It seemed for a brief second that Trump had been able to reach a compromise with the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

George W Bush declared a national emergency in the days following 9/11, for example.
FEB15	Shamima Begum may not have known what she got herself into with Isis, but then neither did western governments	A tidal wave of hypocrisy has greeted the discovery of the Bethnal Green schoolgirl and Isis bride Shamima Begum in a refugee camp in eastern Syria. Grandstanding politicians like Sajid Javid, the home secretary, say they will do everything to stop her coming back to the UK and might seek to put her on trial as a terrorist if she did return.  It is a symptom of the parochialism of British political life that debate rages over the fate of Begum and her possible complicity in Isis crimes. But there is scarcely a word of well-informed discussion about the role of the British and other western governments in creating the circumstances in which Isis was able to create a powerful de facto state in the heart of the Middle East. 
FEB15	Mea Culpa: a short headline word causes trouble amid ambiguity	The old journalistic standby “amid” is a useful word, especially in headlines. It is short, and can link two things without necessarily saying one is caused by the other. But we probably use it too often.  Yesterday we said: “May could face another humiliating defeat in Commons amid open Tory rebellion.” The reader can work out that the humiliating defeat would be the result of the Tory rebellion, rather than the two things happening to occur at the same time. 
FEB15	What do we do about teenagers’ mental health if cannabis is legalised?	My son suffers from depression, and he uses cannabis. Throughout his treatment, mental health services have said that the strength of the cannabis is having a massive impact on the mental health of users.

She is zigzagging between appeasing the Eurosceptic wing of her party and trying to keep her soft-Brexit ministers from resigning. 
FEB15	Arguing whether Winston Churchill or Shamima Begum are ‘the bad guys’ makes fools out of us all	Just for fun, imagine that parliament is six weeks away from a cliff-edge deadline, and desperately scrabbling to untie and retie a constitutional Gordian knot in such a way that it might hold the country together. What is the one question that you’d most like to ask the shadow chancellor? Is it: Winston Churchill – hero or villain? Me too, and thankfully we’re in luck, because someone has asked John McDonnell exactly that and now it’s all that anyone can talk about. Phew – crisis averted. McDonnell’s answer – “Tonypandy. Villain.” – has had some people passionately applauding, others spitting in outrage, and perhaps a handful wondering whether they’d missed a new show on CBeebies. For those in the last group, it's the site of a miners’ strike that turned violent in 1910, with one miner killed and hundreds of citizens injured. As the home secretary when armed troops were sent in, Churchill’s role is controversial to say the least.
FEB15	Why the rise of populism in western Europe is more than a ‘cultural backlash’	The rise of populism in Western Europe is often explained by “culture”. An obsessively liberal approach to migration, gender and LGBT values, the argument goes, has resulted in a backlash from a part of society anchored to traditional national and religious values.  In fact, this argument has been promoted by liberal thinkers. David Goodhart talks about a clash between cosmopolitan and mobile “anywheres” and the less mobile, local “somewheres”. He reckons those elites are failing to acknowledge the traditional values put forward by “somewheres”. 
FEB15	Is no-deal Brexit dead? Depends which Tory minister you’re talking to	Never mind the Brexit “deal”; how’s no deal going? As usual with Brexit, it depends who you ask. Alistair Burt, an oldschool Europhile foreign office minister: “We are not leaving without a deal. If you want to leave, you’d better agree on one. In the next fortnight would help.”
FEB16	The government’s settled status scheme isn’t working – and the results will be catastrophic for EU migrants	Elly Wright is a 77-year-old Dutch widow living in Epsom, Surrey. She’s a painter, and has been in the country for 52 years, earned her Master’s degree at the University of Kent, has a British son, and is an upstanding member of her community. She got permanent residency in November 2017, which means that obtaining settled status, the Home Office’s post-Brexit plan which would provide EU citizens with the right to stay, should be an extremely easy and straightforward process. Yet, in the current pilot scheme, which the government is testing out before 29 March, Elly’s experience has been nothing short of horrific. “Pulling my hair out. Tears of frustration. Been phoning the [government] helpline several times,” she wrote on Facebook. The reason behind her difficulties appear to be linked to complications surrounding her last names, having two married and one maiden surname. They’ve given her settled status with her maiden name, despite having permanent residency and multiple documents with her married surname, which she took 28 years ago, and now the process of having it amended is arduous, and is still pending.
FEB16	Yes, Shamima Begum has made mistakes – but it’s time for this misguided teenager to return home	Two teenage girls whose lives have been driven by their beliefs made headline news this week. One sits stateless and heavily pregnant in a squalid refugee camp in Northern Syria, begging to come back to Britain. The other young woman refuses to attend school on Fridays and stages a weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament, holding a placard reading “School Strike for the Climate”. Greta Thunberg’s campaign to force adults to stop prevaricating and act to save the planet has inspired thousands of like-minded young people.

FEB16	Every prime minister needs a Lady Falkender	After Harold Wilson met Marcia Williams in 1956, his speeches suddenly “became full of irony and satire”, according to our obituary of her by Terry Lancaster, former political editor of the Daily Mirror.  Wilson noted the date they met, 23 April, and gave her a ring inscribed 23456 to mark it. History noticed the change in him. Previously a dull speaker, the shadow chancellor lifted himself to the front rank by his parliamentary duels with Harold Macmillan. 
FEB16	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.
FEB16	The Shamima Begum debate plays right into Theresa May’s hands	The furore over Shamima Begum is unfathomable. Theresa May is using this as a smokescreen to divert public attention from her failure to negotiate a good withdrawal deal with the EU.  As home secretary, May once asked universities and colleges to essentially spy on Muslims. And while the idea of identifying people who are vulnerable to extremism and radicalisation is to be applauded, it was bound to class the entire Muslim community as suspicious and drive a chasm between Muslims and non-Muslims in this age of populism, antisemitism and Islamophobia. It also fails to address the root causes of homegrown terrorism and acknowledge Britain’s complicity in the gruesome atrocities perpetrated in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict.
FEB16	To women vicars like me, it’s no surprise there are still people who believe we shouldn’t exist	“A woman who claims to be a pastor is … just as a [sic] bad as a sex offender who is hired as a pastor.” This tweet from a self-proclaimed Christian was doing the rounds this week and was vastly seen, shared, and commented on. This perspective isn’t new to female church leaders though. The famous 19th-century Baptist minister Charles Spurgeon in one of his sermons repeated a story of Samuel Johnson hearing of a woman preaching, to which he responded: “Sir, a woman’s preaching is like a dog walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.”
FEB16	Why do Trump's biggest fans still believe him when he lies? The answer is in the human brain	President Donald Trump has just declared a national emergency after signing a bipartisan spending bill to fund the government and avoid another shutdown. The national emergency declaration, which will allow Trump to bypass Congress and free up more money for border wall construction, comes more than a month after Trump first proposed the idea of using an emergency order to fund the wall that he said Mexico would pay for. 
FEB16	Young people are at the end of their tether – which is why we'll march for a Final Say on Brexit	It’s strange to think that the formerly abstract threat of Brexit has somehow failed to become any clearer in the two years since the result of the EU referendum was delivered. But there’s no getting around the fact that Brexit, and all the frothy-mouthed, ill-informed debating that’s come with it, has become the bane of all of our lives at this point, especially those of us it’ll end up affecting the most in the long run, should it come to pass.
FEB16	We stand on the brink of a historic, national collapse – it’s time to take to the streets to stop Brexit	Every generation likes to see themselves as though they are on the precipice of history. We like to feel that our actions could have a profound impact on our children, our children’s children and their descendents too. In the urgency of the present, we can easily exaggerate the influence our choices will have on determining the future.
FEB16	A Final Say could be on the horizon – here’s how we could get a second Brexit referendum	Campaigners who want the people to have a Final Say on Brexit have announced that a march will take place on 23 March demanding that the matter be “Put to the People”. But what needs to happen for their demand to be met? There can be a new referendum on Brexit only if there is a majority in the House of Commons for it. That means Jeremy Corbyn has to support it, and he has to ask Labour MPs to vote for it. Some of them would ignore his request, but they might be outweighed by a number of pro-EU Conservative MPs voting against their party line. 
FEB17	The future is unclear for Brexit, but marching for a second referendum could finally give us clarity	What we dignify as democracy is a far more complex thing than is usually admitted, but by and large it can be reduced to this: when given the chance, we vote. Many don’t, of course, and very few who do assume that much will change. But most of us vote in non-marginal seats when we can for this simple reason. It’s all we have. It is the only way to be heard.
FEB17	Italy must face up to its fascist past – no amount of revisionism will erase its legacy of suffering	The return of Christian Masset, the French Ambassador in Italy on Friday 15 February has not been the end of Italian diplomatic crises. European Parliament president Antonio Tajani and Italy’s deputy prime minister and minister of the interior, Matteo Salvini were accused by Slovenia of “historical revisionism” following last Sunday’s celebration in Basovizza, near the Slovenian border, during National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe. Croatia also protested following the two Italian politicians’ speeches.
FEB17	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.
FEB17	Sainsbury’s and Asda executives will benefit from the proposed merger – but it’s unlikely anyone else will	Millions of us will go to either Sainsbury’s or Asda this weekend. We are now just a matter of days away from being told whether the two of them can become one.  The Competition Commission’s provisional findings on their proposed mega-merger will have far-reaching implications for both businesses, their suppliers, partners, employees and for all of us who shop at one, or the other, or both of them. 
FEB17	The Top 10: Songs By Bands About Being in a Band	Thanks to Steven Panthera for this one. A lot of nominations, so I was strict, ruling out “Bennie and the Jets” and “Holiday Inn” because Elton John is a solo artist rather than a band. The same went for “The Free Electric Band” by Albert Hammond.  1. “The One in the Middle”, Manfred Mann, 1965. “Let me tell you about the Manfreds” – including a personnel check. Nominated by Teri Walsh and Pat Harty. 
FEB17	Peckham's new hairdressing hub is a great example of how gentrification can have a positive effect	From Brixton to Hackney, various areas across London are undergoing significant change. Gentrification is certainly not a new topic of discussion and is a seemingly inevitable eventuality, especially in London.  Currently, it is mainly being executed in favour of middle-class taste, with little consideration for those living in the area long before any renovation plans were introduced. This often drives deprived and minority communities, as well as local businesses, out. However, Southwark Council have taken a different approach to regeneration through their latest project – Peckham Palms. 
FEB17	A no-deal Brexit would destroy UK science – and this is how	Let us not pull punches here. UK science got hit the day after the Brexit vote and damage has continued, under the radar, for well over two years since that date. However, the new threat of a no-deal Brexit has added a more dramatic set of complicated factors that are ramping up some serious damage to UK science right now, whatever happens. One week after the referendum result, we at Scientists for EU sent out a call for researchers to record their experiences of the immediate impact from the vote. Our reading and classification of more than 400 entries from those first few weeks after the vote, many confidential, suggested to us that overnight, the UK had become less attractive as a place to do science.
FEB17	Why it took a lot more than physical distance for me to feel truly free from my abusive ex	We’ve all heard the expression “opposites attract”. An idea so routinely accepted that, in my experience, it’s often led to convincing myself to “give him a chance” despite my instincts pleading with me to do the opposite. Nonetheless, a partner whose characteristics and interests that differ from your own can be stimulating and exciting. And I’ve always thought  “#CoupleGoals” romantic partners on Instagram who squat together and toast their wine glasses in synchronised Boomerangs must be a facade.
FEB17	Repatriating Isis fighters is a complex issue – but it’s not one that Donald Trump can solve	Donald Trump has declared that Britain, France and Germany should take back and put on trial its citizens who have gone to fight for Isis in Syria. The US has captured some 800 such fighters, and the president has threatened to release them if the UK and other European nations do not do so. It is easy to see why the US is pushing this line. In December Mr Trump, against the advice of the US military leadership, decided to withdraw troops from Syria. As The Independent’s Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn has argued, this decision was more rational than the president’s opponents claim.
FEB17	The Britain I knew fought for the greater good, so I’m marching for a Final Say referendum	“I want my country back!”, they’ve been shouting, only the country they think they remember never really existed. But the country I remember for most of my life did exist and is in great danger of being stolen.
FEB18	After everything Honda’s done for this country, we keep letting them down – I can’t blame them for leaving	Today, down at various docks in the UK, there are thousands of shiny, sporty British made Honda Civic cars ready for export all over the world. They are there because Swindon is the world production centre for one of the company’s most important products. The cars going on to the transporter ships now will arrive in Japan – the “home market” – towards the end of March, around Brexit day in fact. It was always a signal compliment to the quality of the cars made by Japanese firms in Britain, that they were deemed good enough for customers in Tokyo as well as Torquay.
FEB18	I don’t like Brexit or antisemitism either, but I still feel betrayed by the defecting Labour MPs	The news that seven Labour MPs have decided to resign from the party and form a new alliance does not come as a surprise. In many ways it has been a long time coming. Since Jeremy Corbyn was first elected leader there has been a clear split between those on the right of the party, who find him to be a threat, and those on the left, who are glad to finally have a true socialist onside. In many ways, the friction was inevitable, but it’s an MP’s job to deal with that. What these MPs have done is essentially split the left-wing vote.
FEB18	The vicious media ‘boys club’ trying to shut women up is as prevalent in Britain as it is in France	Women hoping to make it in the media have always had a tough time. The industry is as macho as it is competitive, and professional rivalries frequently descend into bitterness and quarrels. Such angst has reached boiling point in France, where prosecutors are examining a criminal complaint of sexist and racist harassment about a “boys club” that bullied female colleagues online.
FEB18	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.
FEB18	The government should proceed with caution when it comes to cannabis	New research has reopened the question of the harm caused by cannabis. A study in a journal published by the American Medical Association suggests 60,000 cases of depression in the UK could be caused by teenage use of marijuana.  This reinforces The Independent’s unfashionable caution about legalising soft drugs. While we welcomed Sajid Javid’s decision as home secretary to review the law on the medical use of cannabis, we warned about its association with mental illness. We argued that more research is needed before Britain presses ahead with the wider legalisation of the drug.
FEB18	Every prime minister needs a Lady Falkender	After Harold Wilson met Marcia Williams in 1956, his speeches suddenly “became full of irony and satire”, according to our obituary of her by Terry Lancaster, former political editor of the Daily Mirror.  Wilson noted the date they met, 23 April, and gave her a ring inscribed 23456 to mark it. History noticed the change in him. Previously a dull speaker, the shadow chancellor lifted himself to the front rank by his parliamentary duels with Harold Macmillan. 
FEB18	Here in France, the gilet jaunes are ruining lives, and after the vile attack on Alain Finkielkraut I can't support them any longer	Fourteen weeks ago, when our youngest son was looking forward to his fifth birthday party, I never expected to have to explain why my family wanted to drive across the roundabout at the bottom of our street in the southwestern town of Castres, so we could get to the party destination, but I did.  It was the first week of the gilet jaunes protest in France, a groundswell movement of people who, connected by social media and their now iconic high-visibility vests every driver has to have in their cars, decided to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron and his government. 
FEB18	Angela Smith’s ‘funny tinge’ comment is just the tip of the iceberg – these Labour defectors are anything but progressive	There are few more meaningless Blairite phrases than “modern Britain”, and this cliche was unfortunately given another outing by formerly Labour MPs today as the Dinner Party Seven launched their breakaway independent group. Yet it didn’t take long for them to look decidedly unmodern – about an hour and a half to be precise. No sooner had Angela Smith, one of the seven, sat down in a BBC studio than she burbled something about brown people having a “funny tinge”, thereby plunging the new group into its first race row (and then its first apology).
FEB18	If The Independent Group really believes in accountability, it’ll do the right thing and hold by-elections	The Labour Party has always been home to many different political traditions, all united with the common goal of getting a Labour government and social justice. I disagreed with some things New Labour did but I rolled my sleeves up and contributed where I thought we could make a positive difference. It never once occurred to me that a Labour government was worse than a Tory one, and in my view, you cross a line when you’re elected as a Labour MP but don’t want the leader of the Labour Party to be prime minister.
FEB18	Now that the New Labour boil has been lanced, we might finally get back to real business in politics	So, following the carefully drip-fed reports about a possible Labour split exercising the media commentariat over many weeks, they’ve finally gone. The tendency that these deserters represent actually has a long history, traceable right back to Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher’s determination to drag the political centre ground dramatically to the right. And so we ended up with a “New Labour” government, led by Thatcher’s “greatest achievement” – Blair – that imposed many neoliberal free-market policies that were essentially indistinguishable from the Tory policies. The mammoth book Blair’s Supremacy by Lewis Minkin provides all the gory details on how Blair and his henchman systematically captured the Labour Party and turned it into a right-wing social democratic party, “intensely relaxed” about “the filthy rich” (Peter Mandelson), and with power ruthlessly centralised to minimise any semblance of genuine democracy.
FEB19	Shamima Begum could have been a powerful tool for Britain. By stripping her of her citizenship, we have failed ourselves	Is Britain any safer now that Shamima Begum’s citizenship has been revoked? The answer has to be ‘no’. Remorse or not, there should never have been any question about whether Shamima Begum of Bethnal Green would be allowed back into Britain. Certainly, so drastic a measure as to revoke her British citizenship reflects poorly on a country that regularly requests others to repatriate their illegal immigrants.  In May, a proposed bilateral deal for India to facilitate the return of thousands of its illegal immigrants ran into trouble partly because New Delhi considered some of them a security risk. The same sort of consideration – only heightened because of the Isis connection – seems to have come into play during Shamima Begum’s case, going by the comment recently made by Alex Younger, head of MI6, that Britons who went to join Isis are “potentially very dangerous”.
FEB19	I'm a 31-year-old Hispanic woman who backs Bernie Sanders — stop pretending that I don't exist	As I grabbed my phone this morning to snooze my alarm at around 7:30am, I saw the notification that Bernie Sanders had (finally) announced his bid for presidency. I donated $27 before I fully opened my eyes.  Waking up with a sense of hope instead of the impending doom we have all become casually accustomed to was a nice change. What hadn’t changed was the tired and recycled narrative about Bernie supporters online. As if the fever dream of the Trump presidency hadn’t even begun, out came the flood of tweets warning about the return of the hated “Bernie Bros.” And with these 2016 cries, I felt the same feelings of frustration and erasure I felt during the last democratic primary.
FEB19	Here in Mexico, this is what people actually think of Donald Trump's ridiculous border wall	While it has been hard to ignore President Trump’s anti-Mexican vitriol since even before he took office, the ridiculous idea that this country would pay for the border wall has always been a bit of a sad joke here in Mexico.  Nevertheless, what initially seemed to Mexicans as bombastic campaign rhetoric has now become a potential reality with Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his project that, obviously, Mexico wouldn’t pay for. 
FEB19	Just like Trump, America’s UN ambassador nominees serve only to transform the careers of TV stars	In a surprise move this past weekend, Heather Nauert withdrew herself from consideration to be the US envoy to the United Nations, reportedly due to legal irregularities around a household employee. The sudden development amplifies questions about the direction of US engagement with the world body and whether the Trump Administration sees the UN as a policy-making forum, or just a PR prop. Foreign diplomats may have enjoyed working with Nauert, an Emmy-nominated TV personality. But her nomination illustrates how the UN is increasingly seen: as a stage for political theatrics.
FEB19	As a former child soldier, I know that governments are overlooking the young girls I fought with in warzones	At the age of 15, I had already spent three years fighting in the civil war in my home country of Sierra Leone. Having lost both of my parents, my brothers and my home to the conflict at 12 years old, I thought the army might offer me some safety. Instead I was forced to fight, forced to kill and to witness a whole new world of violence and terror. There was very little international protection for children in my position at that time – some of us didn’t even technically “exist” – we had no documentation, no birth records – nothing to prove who we were. By the time we left the military, it was symbolic of the way we felt.
FEB19	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.
FEB19	I've written a few obituaries in my time — and I think we owe it to ourselves to be honest about Karl Lagerfeld	Karl Lagerfeld died on Tuesday, leaving behind him countless contributions to fashion history, an indelible influence on runways around the world, and a complicated legacy. It’s always tempting – and only human – to focus on the positives when speaking of the dead, especially so soon after their passing. Acknowledging some of the less palatable aspects of someone’s life at such a time can seem in poor taste, rude, and slightly unfair. Indeed, there has been abundant praise for Lagerfeld, who has been eulogised as a “legend”, a “creative force”, an “irreplaceable”, “iconic” genius, with model Claudia Schiffer going as far as to say: “What Warhol was to art, he was to fashion.”
FEB19	Eight of his MPs have quit, but Jeremy Corbyn could only stubbornly reiterate that he is never wrong about anything	In front of around 500 people, Jeremy Corbyn strode on to the stage to the sound of about six hands clapping. “Thank you so much for that warm reception,” he said. The reception had not been warm at all, but these were the words he had already decided to say, and so say them he did. It was, in its way, a beautifully clear window into the Corbyn psyche, which is best understood as that of a wasp. When a dying wasp flies to the top of a window for the hundredth time, then stumbles to the bottom and tries again, it is not because it is stupid, as such, it is because it is biologically incapable of learning. It is born and it will die with all the cognitive function it will ever have. It is, quite literally, stubborn by nature.
FEB19	Traditional political techniques are no longer working – party splits and Brexit uncertainty are proof	It would be easier to have some faith in the future of democratic politics if so many in the Labour Party hadn’t reacted so sourly to the defection of seven MPs to the new Independent Group. The tweet from Young Labour is a depressingly typical example of this particular tendency: “Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the red flag flying here.”
FEB19	Thanks to Karl Lagerfeld’s problematic views, the fashion industry was forced to face some ugly truths	Karl Lagerfeld was arguably the most powerful man in fashion. At the helm of Chanel, he was extremely influential, even the self-professed fashion illiterate would easily recognise the interlocked “CC” monograph of Coco Chanel, which he integrated into the House of Chanel. But he also attracted, courted and initiated controversy with his stances on fur, feminism and the far right. Peta’s tweet, written by their founder Ingrid Newkirk, in response to Lagerfeld’s death has drawn the most backlash today:
FEB20	Shamima Begum could have been a powerful tool for Britain. By stripping her of her citizenship, we have failed ourselves	Is Britain any safer now that Shamima Begum’s citizenship has been revoked? The answer has to be ‘no’. Remorse or not, there should never have been any question about whether Shamima Begum of Bethnal Green would be allowed back into Britain.

FEB20	The defectors were wrong to resign – but that doesn't mean Labour doesn't have problems	Last night Joan Ryan was the eighth Labour MP to defect to the new Independent Group on Monday. This will not help the Labour Party. No doubt, some of what they had to say about the way the party has been run recently was justified, but criticism on its own is not enough. Complaining about Brexit and anti-semitism is all very well, but where is their positive vision for the future? What has anyone on the left got to say about this? With or without the eight defectors, the Labour Party in the UK has a problem at the ballot box. Despite all the divisions and disarray in the Conservative Party, Labour is still some 7 per cent behind in the polls, and there is little sign that a more moderate version of the present Labour Party would do much better than the one which we have at the moment.

FEB20	Germany may not be in recession, but US trade disputes aren’t exactly making things easier	The sun is shining, though the snow is still on the ground outside the gleaming headquarters of BMW here in Munich. But there is a chill wind blowing through the German motor industry and, by extension, through the German economy. If the current spat between the US administration and the European Commission on car tariffs develops into a trade war, then the wind will become chillier yet.
FEB20	I've written a few obituaries in my time — and I think we owe it to ourselves to be honest about Karl Lagerfeld	Karl Lagerfeld died on Tuesday, leaving behind him countless contributions to fashion history, an indelible influence on runways around the world, and a complicated legacy.

FEB20	Liam Fox is kidding himself if he thinks he'll have the upper hand in tomorrow's trade negotiations with the US	Tomorrow MPs will debate a trade deal with the United States. They should make the most of it, because it could be the only chance they get to air their opinions on this subject before a standard-slashing “America first”, trade deal is brought back for them to approve. And approve it they will have to do – under the current system there’s no practical way for MPs to stop a trade deal they don’t like. In a democratic country, you might expect that Thursday would be the point at which parliament would be able to set Liam Fox’s negotiating objectives, draw red lines, or apply some sort of framework which lays out the type of trade deal Britain wants with the US. But that’s now how Brexit Britain works, and MPs will only know what the secretary of state wants them to know. They have no right to see any of the negotiating texts, or any legal advice, impact assessments or anything beyond an occasional bland update.
FEB20	I looked into the sexist targetting of mothers under truancy laws – here's what I uncovered	Parents of truanting children have been pursued ever more aggressively by councils in recent years. There’s endless talk of a “government crackdown” on unauthorised absences, while parents frequently find themselves hit with fines for taking their children on term-time holidays. Wherever you stand on the issue of a parent’s right to choose what’s best for their child, there is a gross miscarriage of justice here – the sexism that imbues our society has reached new heights, and mothers are once again held to impossibly high standards compared to their male coparents.
FEB20	Eight of his MPs have quit, but Jeremy Corbyn could only stubbornly reiterate that he is never wrong about anything	In front of around 500 people, Jeremy Corbyn strode on to the stage to the sound of about six hands clapping. “Thank you so much for that warm reception,” he said.

FEB21	The Jussie Smollett press conference in Chicago was tense — but for a black queer man like me, it was also deeply upsetting	I’m on holiday in Chicago. As I was in bed this morning staving off jetlag by scrolling through Twitter, I read of a press conference at the Chicago Police Department in relation to the Jussie Smollett case. As a queer black man, I have been following the story closely and after seeing that the press conference was happening 10 minutes from my friend’s apartment, I felt an Olivia Pope-like urge to go. I (perhaps narcissistically) felt it was important for me to be a representative of the QTPOC community in a room which I presumed would be overwhelmingly white — and luckily I managed to talk my way in. The tension in that room was palpable, and as Chicago PD superintendent Eddie Johnson walked in, the look of despair on his face amplified that tension tenfold. As he revealed the details of Jussie Smollett’s allegedly false claims, it was clear that he was horrendously disappointed. His words were potent and he didn’t hide his emotion. He said Jussie had orchestrated an attack with the help of two men, paying them $3500. He supposed that Jussie’s injuries were self-inflicted and the threatening letter he received was sent himself. Superintendent Johnson seemed embarrassed and ashamed of Jussie, and it felt particularly resonant this chastisement coming from a him, a black man. 
FEB21	I am the mother of an Isis fighter who died in Syria. This is my message to Shamima Begum and her family	With coverage of Shamima Begum dominating headlines, and debate about her return to the United Kingdom taking over social media, my thoughts turn towards her family here in the UK. Like them, my child chose the wrong path. Like Shamima, my son’s vulnerabilities were exploited by evil Isis terrorists who persuaded him to travel to Syria. Not a day goes by when I don’t ask myself if I could have, or should have, done more to spot the signs that my son Rasheed was at risk. 
FEB21	White people, there's something you need to learn from the case of Coast Guard Lt Christopher Paul Hasson	This week, a story broke about a US Coast Guard named Lt. Christopher Paul Hasson and his alleged plot to attack prominent Democrats and media personalities to “murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely ever seen.” Upon searching his apartment, authorities found 15 guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, with prosecutors not only calling him a “self-proclaimed white supremacist” but a “domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life.”  While many in power remain silent on Hasson, they have been vocal about the case of Hoda Muthana, who also made headlines recently as for being denied a return to America after travelling to Syria as an “Isis bride”. Muthana left her hometown of Alabama in 2014 to join the terror group. She says she is now vehemently opposed to Isis and would like to return to the US — not with a free pass, but in order to go through the judicial system. She has been denied that right and stripped of her birthright citizenship by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (“I have instructed Secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back in the country!” Trump tweeted yesterday.) It remains to be seen whether this will stand up after a legal challenge from her family.
FEB21	Thanks, Donald Trump, but as a gay man I'd rather you didn't go on a global campaign in my name	In news that few people expected, the Trump administration has announced the launch of a global campaign to end the criminalisation of homosexuality worldwide. Next week, the US embassy is reportedly flying LGBT+ activists from across Europe to Berlin to plan a push for decriminalisation in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. As a gay man, I find the idea that anyone like me is considered a criminal simply for their identity extremely distressing. Seventy countries currently criminalise same-sex acts and, in many more, LGBT+ people face systemic persecution, discrimination and violence. Yet while I am, of course, pro-decriminalisation, I am sceptical of this announcement from the Trump administration. 
FEB21	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.

FEB21	Liberals didn't believe Jussie Smollett because we're stupid — we believed him because of what Trump has done to America	On 29 January, Empire actor Jussie Smollett captured the world's attention. Smollett alleged that around 2am in Chicago, he was called racial and homophobic slurs and beaten by Trump supporters who yelled “This is MAGA country." What made the attack appear even more gruesome was the allegation that he was covered in bleach and a rope was tied around his neck. The details were horrific, sparking national outrage days before the start of Black History Month. But, as the details began to unfold, it became clear that Smollett may have faked the attack. News and police reports since have suggested that he hired two Nigerian actors to stage it. Smollett has since been arrested and charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report to the Chicago Police Department. It’s been suggested that he could have staged the attack because he was dissatisfied with this salary on Empire.
FEB21	Don’t tell me Shamima Begum’s baby didn’t know what it was doing when it was conceived by a traitor	I hope Sajid Javid is careful with Shamima Begum, the Isis supporter he’s trying to keep out of the country. Because after Brexit we might be desperate for a trade deal with the Islamic caliphate, as it could be the only place we can import stuff from. And Begum may be the ideal trade secretary, as she’s lived in both places. I expect Liam Fox will correct things soon, by announcing: “Shamima is one of several hundred of our young people who left here to fight in Syria, proving that Jihadis are yet another product we are successfully exporting at an impressive rate. I am proud to announce this morning I concluded a deal with the caliphate, for 35 more disillusioned teenagers from Birmingham, creating employment and showing once again that Britain is OPEN FOR BUSINESS.”
FEB21	Don’t be complacent – Isis may have lost territory, but the battle is far from over	Some legitimate states embrace terror and terrorists – North Korea, the Taliban in Afghanistan, Gaddafi’s Libya – but it is unusual to witness a terrorist group creating their own viable nation state. Or “caliphate” as Isis once styled its vast domains. At its height, this medieval death cult, astonishingly, ruled over large oil-rich swathes of Syria and Iraq, stretching from the border with Turkey almost to Iran and Jordan.
FEB21	We’ve upset Japan, China and Bangladesh this week alone – post-Brexit Britain won’t have any trade links at this rate	One of the many unintended consequences of Brexit is that “Global Britain” seems curiously friendless. We have proved remarkably inept at “taking back control” of our foreign policy, though the British fancy themselves as expert negotiators and diplomats (they’re even offering paid courses in it). We are, in fact, losing friends we will dearly need in future.

FEB22	Mea Culpa: a chess metaphor that ended up in banking	In an article about Donald Trump and his wall, we said it would land “the American people with a $5bn (£3.9bn) check that somebody else was meant to pay”. Thanks to Julian Self for pointing this out. Our style is British English, which is cheque. For younger readers, this is a piece of paper used make a payment from a bank account before plastic cards and smartphones came along. Apparently they still use them in the US, where they spell it check. 
FEB22	The Democrats are using the same strategy for the Green New Deal as the Republicans used for healthcare. Bad idea	Earlier this month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democrat Senator Ed Markey introduced a resolution calling for a Green New Deal. Numerous Democrats signed on as co-sponsors, including five declared presidential candidates. As we now know, the plan is very ambitious, calling for the US to generate 100 per cent of its electricity through “clean, renewable, zero-emission energy sources” and upgrade “all existing buildings in the United States” within 10 years. The GNR also includes goals that are, at best, tangentially related to climate, such as union rights, a job guarantee, and universal healthcare. An FAQ Ocasio-Cortez’s office posted online and sent to media outlets added “economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to work,” but Ocasio-Cortez then said that was a mistake and retracted it.
FEB22	Let us march once more for a Final Say on Brexit	The danger is real. By “running down the clock” on Brexit, the prime minister plainly hopes to force – blackmail, if you prefer – MPs to choose between her deal or no deal. The atmosphere being deliberately generated is increasingly panicky.
FEB22	Liberals didn't believe Jussie Smollett because we're stupid — we believed him because of what Trump has done to America	On 29 January, Empire actor Jussie Smollett captured the world's attention. Smollett alleged that around 2am in Chicago, he was called racial and homophobic slurs and beaten by Trump supporters who yelled “This is MAGA country." What made the attack appear even more gruesome was the allegation that he was covered in bleach and a rope was tied around his neck. The details were horrific, sparking national outrage days before the start of Black History Month. But, as the details began to unfold, it became clear that Smollett may have faked the attack. News and police reports since have suggested that he hired two Nigerian actors to stage it. Smollett has since been arrested and charged with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report to the Chicago Police Department. It’s been suggested that he could have staged the attack because he was dissatisfied with this salary on Empire.
FEB22	Applying for 'settled status' as an EU citizen has shown me how the government discriminates against women	Since Brexit negotiations began in 2016, EU citizens have found themselves in a vulnerable position. Stripped of our rights of free movement, and with the threat of losing our livelihoods and possibly having to leave a country we now consider home, we are now faced with a new form of discrimination – the settled status, a government application process which offers EU citizens the right to reside in Britain. This is despite the UK being our home over many years – decades for some of us – and where our children have grown up.
FEB22	I was arrested for protesting against US nukes in Brussels – this is why I chose to take a stand	It's not every day you find yourself lying on a freezing military runway at 7 o'clock in the morning. I don’t take breaking the law lightly, so why did we decide to climb a three-metre barbed-wire fence to break into the Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium where the country stores US bombs? There are 15,000 nuclear bombs still in circulation in the world and about 20 nuclear bombs are still present at the Kleine Brogel military base. The UK’s own arsenal is an estimated 215 nuclear warheads, each of which is far more deadly than the first nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
FEB22	I've seen many political defections before, but this is different – we're on the brink of something momentous	Defections are the hard currency of politics. In between elections, MPs’ changes of party reveal the tectonic shifts beneath the slowly changing landscape. Ian Austin is the latest, leaving the Labour Party to sit as an independent, although he is not joining the Independent Group (yet).  When I started as a political journalist before the 1983 general election, the Social Democratic Party had just broken away from Labour. I’m afraid I thought they were traitors and I had a particularly low opinion of Shirley Williams. 
FEB23	The far right’s appeal to women is getting stronger, and their tactics are working	Fascism vs feminism? On the surface, there’s no contest. At street level, the neo-fash, rooted in incel and MRA culture, appears the sworn enemy of women’s rights in any form. At the theoretical level, up where Conservative think tanks and theologians operate, feminism is the arch-nemesis: part of an unholy triumvirate that, with gay marriage and everything gender non-conforming, is part of the plot to destroy society by undermining established gender roles and the traditional family.
FEB23	Despite the cabinet revolt, Theresa May’s Brexit star is rising	Today, in “Constitutional Innovations Induced by Brexit”, we have the concept of optional collective responsibility. Three cabinet ministers, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke, have written an article explaining why the government’s policy is wrong.  Last year Rudd resigned because she told a select committee what her civil servant told her to say, but this time she has merely contradicted the prime minister on the central question facing the nation and undermined the government’s negotiating position in Brussels. 
FEB23	Calls to protect Kenya’s wetlands to save key water sources	By Jeckonia Otieno, The Standard This year the world came together in February in support of World Wetlands Day. Climate change is said to be a strong focus this year, pushing the theme - healthy wetlands, healthy communities - as it is said one cannot survive without the other.
FEB23	How can we celebrate the art of Karl Lagerfeld – who said such controversial things? Here's how I do it	Shortly after the news broke that fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld had died, I wrote a profile about his design legacy. I was soon met with messages from friends and colleagues, asking me how – as a feminist journalist – I reconciled my fashion writing with some of the things the late Chanel and Fendi creative director had said. He had called women “too fat”, criticised the Me Too movement and made an Islamophobic comment in reference to Angela Merkel welcoming Syrian refugees into Germany. He had stood by a friend accused of sexual assault.
FEB23	John McDonnell’s promising comments show there is hope left for a Final Say referendum	A politician declaring that they are “moving closer” to something usually means very little. It is a form of words often deployed to suggest that they would like their interviewer, and readers, as appropriate, to form the view that they are indeed agreeing with them, while not actually committing themselves to anything remotely specific: a weaselly device. With Labour and Brexit, though, the usual rules of political combat are altered. The slightest nuances in meaning from the lips of the leadership are carefully and deliberately measured, such is the party’s delicate balance, and crumbling unity, on Brexit. So when the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tells the Evening Standard that Labour is now “moving towards” a second referendum on Brexit, those few scant words carry more weight than they might usually.
FEB23	A bizarre funding craze has taken over naive, liberal-hating Republican America	One hundred and twenty-one people have donated to Angel Fox's GoFundMe. Her promise? To fly to London and “stand watch” over the Ecuadorian Embassy, in which Australian national and noted Manafort liaison Julian Assange has been holed up in since 2012.  “I intend to stand watch [to make sure] Assange is safe during the night. In order to do this, I have to take a leave from my job and will be depending on donations for expenses during this time,” she wrote in the pitch. “The sooner I receive funds, the sooner I can fly from Michigan to London and start aiding in the protection of Julian Assange.”
FEB23	How the LGBT+ community of today is making history for the youth of tomorrow	Visibility matters. For the youth of today to see young transgender characters on shows like Butterfly, a mainstream TV show with famous actors, is monumental. Not only does it serve as a powerful representation for trans youth fighting against the hostility towards their identities, but it also works as an important source of knowledge for the general public who might be unfamiliar with the trials and tribulations of the LGBT+ community.
FEB23	North West Kardashian hasn't said she wants to be the face of a 'new generation'. She's five years old	North West, the five-year-old daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, has appeared on the front cover of WWD’s Beauty Inc issue. She is pictured with straightened hair and makeup, alongside a caption that reads: “Move Over Millennials: North West Leads The Way As A New Generation Comes Of Age”. This magazine cover is palpably messed up on a number of levels. For starters, the implication that five-year-olds are “of age” is deeply disturbing – and the comments made by the magazine suggest that this delusional messaging wasn’t just a slip of the sub-edit. WWD says: “We've watched North West grow on Instagram and Keeping Up with the Kardashians and magazines — here, she poses for her first solo cover. Her distinct fashion sense belies her age, and lately, so does her eye for makeup.”
FEB23	Brexit and austerity are destroying our economy – but at least we’ve learnt some valuable lessons	I do hope the Tories are proud of their achievement in taking us from the fifth largest and one of the fastest growing economies in the EU to a 12 per cent slide on the value of the pound and a negative impact on GDP growth, thanks to austerity.   With the possibility of a global recession looming, it’s difficult to envision a worse time to be doing Brexit – such are the compound effects of poor judgement and very little planning.
FEB23	I support a Final Say on the Brexit deal, but it won’t resolve our divisions on national identity	It is obvious that only a People’s Vote on the deal can resolve the impasse in parliament. Another referendum, however, will not resolve the divided views on our national identity. As an MP I have witnessed this division first hand. I conducted a survey of my constituents shortly after the referendum in 2016 and another two years later.
FEB24	Society’s poorest will suffer the most from Brexit – which is why we should take to the streets to stop it	Just six days before the dreaded Brexit day, campaigners are gearing up to once again take to the streets in a march for a People’s Vote on Brexit. It is remarkable to see that in the five months since we – around 700,000 of us – were marching on the streets of London, nothing has changed.
FEB24	The far right’s appeal to women is getting stronger, and their tactics are working	Fascism vs feminism? On the surface, there’s no contest.

FEB24	I was raised by domestic servants — whether or not Roma wins Best Picture, we need to talk about the reality	Even though I have followed the success of Roma, Alfonso Cuarón’s drama of a household maid in Mexico City, with fervor, I still find it difficult to grapple with the diametrical opposites I see. On one hand, there’s the sympathetic, saint-like domestic worker figure of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) in the limelight. On the other hand, there’s the current plight of domestic workers around the world and throughout America — one which feels like an afterthought. The domestic worker has been in our gaze before; I saw her as Terry in Anthony Chen's Ilo Ilo; Lola in Alex Tizon’s viral essay about his family’s slave; Viola Davis’ character Aibileen Clark in The Help. Onscreen, the lives of domestic workers capture our attention and our hearts, and it’s easy to see why: depicted with patience and grace, they are stoic in the face of quotidian middle-class family drama, and often rise above the occasion to show the pettiness and selfishness of the family by contrast.
FEB24	Twenty years on, Queer as Folk remains a more radical and fearless tribute to gay life than many LGBT+ shows today	In 2016, during the final weeks of Barack Obama’s presidency, Oprah Winfrey sat down with Michelle Obama as she prepared to return to civilian life. During the interview, Winfrey divulged to the former first lady that she became successful in television after she began thinking of her role as a form of “public service”. Winfrey has certainly made more money than your typical public servant, yet her billionaire status doesn’t change the fact that, just as she theorises, outstanding TV can be just that. Queer as Folk, which turns 20 today, is one of those rare flickers of brilliance. Created by gay screenwriting icon Russell T Davies, the show follows the lives of three gay men – best friends Stuart Jones and Vince Tyler, and 15-year-old Nathan Maloney – living in Manchester’s gay village.
FEB24	How the LGBT+ community of today is making history for the youth of tomorrow	Visibility matters. For the youth of today to see young transgender characters on shows like Butterfly, a mainstream TV show with famous actors, is monumental. Not only does it serve as a powerful representation for trans youth fighting against the hostility towards their identities, but it also works as an important source of knowledge for the general public who might be unfamiliar with the trials and tribulations of the LGBT+ community.
FEB24	Nearly half of people with depression appear happy – this is why ignoring that can be so dangerous	The term “smiling depression” – appearing happy to others while internally suffering depressive symptoms – has become increasingly popular. Articles on the topic have crept up in the popular literature, and the number of Google searches for the condition has increased dramatically this year. Some may question, however, whether this is actually a real, pathological condition. While smiling depression is not a technical term that psychologists use, it is certainly possible to be depressed and manage to successfully mask the symptoms. The closest technical term for this condition is “atypical depression”. In fact, a significant proportion of people who experience a low mood and a loss of pleasure in activities manage to hide their condition in this way. And these people might be particularly vulnerable to suicide.
FEB24	Jeremy Corbyn should listen to Tom Watson about Brexit and antisemitism – he’ll never be prime minister if he doesn’t	Jeremy Corbyn would be wise to act on the candid but brutal advice given to him by his deputy Tom Watson, who has warned that if the Labour leader doesn’t change course, he will never become prime minister. In an explosive interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Watson said Labour would suffer further defections among MPs, peers, councillors and members unless Mr Corbyn reassures the party’s social democratic wing by promoting some of its members to the shadow cabinet or giving it greater influence on policy.
FEB24	Brexit and austerity are destroying our economy – but at least we’ve learnt some valuable lessons	I do hope the Tories are proud of their achievement in taking us from the fifth largest and one of the fastest growing economies in the EU to a 12 per cent slide on the value of the pound and a negative impact on GDP growth, thanks to austerity.   With the possibility of a global recession looming, it’s difficult to envision a worse time to be doing Brexit – such are the compound effects of poor judgement and very little planning.
FEB25	Labour has put a Final Say back on the table – here’s how a second referendum could work	Mustn’t get excited, now. However, the news that Labour will back a second referendum – the Final Say The Independent has been campaigning hard for – could not be more welcome. Even if, for now, it is based solely on Labour’s plan for Brexit, that would still be a move forwards – accepting in principle the validity of a “people’s vote”. In any case Labour is determined to take no deal off the table, and in this the party should be supported by a growing body of opinion in Westminster. How much of this shift is due to the recent defections is a matter of speculation, but beside the point. Labour is moving in the right direction, and placing itself responsibly at the head of a national debate.
FEB25	Trump can help Venezuela without resorting to US military intervention – by negotiating directly with China	As Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido continue to vie for the Venezuelan presidency, Vice President Pence meets with opposition leaders today in Bogota to discuss next steps. To diffuse escalating tensions and help solve what has been called the hemisphere’s biggest humanitarian crisis without US military intervention, the Trump administration should consider direct negotiation with China. 
FEB25	My encounter with Cath Kidston's dinosaurs showed me everyday sexism is alive and well	The floral-print accessories and furnishings retailer Cath Kidston takes great care to describe its dinosaur water bottle in a gender-neutral way – at least, it does online. On the internet it’s just a “kids’ drinking bottle” for keeping “little ones” hydrated. But when I went into one of its stores recently and asked a shop assistant if I could buy a kids water bottle, she immediately asked: “Is it for a boy or girl?”
FEB25	Centrism is finally returning to Israeli politics, but there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned	The negotiations, fraught and tense, went on through the night. And so it wasn’t until 5.30am Thursday morning that the news emerged. Israel’s paratrooper former army chief and the slick leader of one of the country’s main centrist parties had agreed to a merger in the upcoming polls. Benny Gantz, ex-chief of staff who is seen to be less hawkish and right-wing than the incumbent Netanyahu, and Yair Lapid, a former journalist turned head of Yesh Atid party, had merged into the “Blue and White” Party.
FEB25	No, you don’t magically grasp ‘adulting’ when you turn 30 – it’s just an advertising myth to shame young women	My daughter turned 30 at the weekend. I’m not saying she made a big song and dance about it – she didn’t go full Meghan Markle baby shower mad – but she did take the whole thing quite seriously. Let’s just say a trip to Iceland to swim in the Blue Lagoon was involved. I don’t remember anyone making a big deal about turning 30 back in the 1990s when it happened to me and my mates. Thirty wasn’t a “big birthday” back then – we’d had our 18ths and our 21sts and, in terms of fancy cakes and balloon celebrations, that was our lot for decades.
FEB25	John McDonnell’s promising comments show there is hope left for a Final Say referendum	A politician declaring that they are “moving closer” to something usually means very little. It is a form of words often deployed to suggest that they would like their interviewer, and readers, as appropriate, to form the view that they are indeed agreeing with them, while not actually committing themselves to anything remotely specific: a weaselly device. With Labour and Brexit, though, the usual rules of political combat are altered. The slightest nuances in meaning from the lips of the leadership are carefully and deliberately measured, such is the party’s delicate balance, and crumbling unity, on Brexit. So when the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tells the Evening Standard that Labour is now “moving towards” a second referendum on Brexit, those few scant words carry more weight than they might usually.
FEB25	I'm running for president and I think everyone deserves $1,000 a month — so I'm putting my money where my mouth is	The central pillar of my campaign for president of the United States in 2020 is the Freedom Dividend, a form of universal basic income (UBI) that gives every American adult over the age of 18 $1,000 per month. I believe in the transformative power of the Freedom Dividend so much that I’m personally financing two — one in New Hampshire, and one in Iowa.  These two trials are too small to draw strong conclusions, though, so I’ve been following the various UBI trials around the world, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the recent data released by the Finnish government on their trial. While the current results are preliminary, covering only the first year, the results are worth examining.
FEB25	Look below the Academy's woke veneer and you'll see why Green Book actually won Best Picture at the Oscars	If BlacKkKlansman is Hollywood as it wants to see itself, Green Book is Hollywood as it really is. Victory for the white-made race relations comedy at last night’s Oscars makes sense less artistically than as a spiteful reality check. Never mind its scant artistry and relentless, almost uncanny mediocrity.  Against favourites Roma and Bohemian Rhapsody, its win was a bizarre, upsetting end to an evening that had seemed, for the most part, ideologically “right on”. In fact, it was just the final joker in the pack of an Oscars season that saw the Academy in soul-searching mode: a season in which its organising body first proposed then withdrew a best popular film category; cancelled plans to award four technical categories during ad breaks; and rescinded its invitation to sometime homophobe Kevin Hart to host, leaving its presenter slot empty (an unanticipated blessing). 
FEB25	Donald Trump may have actually done something right when it comes to North Korea	Like a faulty shopping trolley, the foreign policy of the Trump administration seems utterly unable to steer anything like a safe and predictable path. This has had mixed consequences. First, foreign entities, friend and foe alike, have in front of them the most wayward president in decades. It used to be called, in the Nixon era, the “mad monk” theory – that the president was so volatile he might do anything, adding credence to the force of America’s nuclear deterrent, for example.
FEB25	Andrea Leadsom is wrong – nothing could be more democratic than a second referendum	What an astonishing statement from Andrea Leadsom. The Commons leader announced that “democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want”. But surely that is exactly what democracy is about, otherwise we’d just hold one general election and that would be the outcome in perpetuity. What else does democracy mean other than repeated attempts by individual voters and parties to change the status quo. Democracies change their minds, that’s the whole point. Michael O’HareNorthwood
FEB26	Theresa May won’t say it, but there’s no chance of a no-deal Brexit now	The prime minister has yielded to the inevitable. It has been apparent for weeks that the majority of the House of Commons does not want to leave the EU without a deal and was prepared to assert its control to make sure that it does not happen.  Yvette Cooper, the alternative prime minister, was going to win the vote on her plan to rule out a no-deal Brexit tomorrow, so the nominal prime minister simply surrendered. 
FEB26	Shamima Begum’s case confirms it – second-generation Britons never really had a place to call home	Once in a while a case comes along which has the capacity to pull the rug from under our feet. Shamima Begum’s is one of them, because it confirmed the fears of first- and second-generation immigrants that they never really belonged to Britain.
FEB26	Trump can help Venezuela without resorting to US military intervention – by negotiating directly with China	As Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido continue to vie for the Venezuelan presidency, Vice President Pence meets with opposition leaders today in Bogota to discuss next steps. To diffuse escalating tensions and help solve what has been called the hemisphere’s biggest humanitarian crisis without US military intervention, the Trump administration should consider direct negotiation with China.

FEB26	Non-binary people deserve to have their identities legally recognised – but the government is standing in the way	For most people, ticking the gender marker on forms is a non-issue. It’s not something that most people even think about. But not being able to self-identify on all types of documentation is damaging and dysphoric for many people. It’s another reminder that those who don’t identify as male or female are not to be seen and aren’t to be catered or cared for in these institutions.
FEB26	As a comedy aficionado, I’m appalled at disgusting ‘jokes’ creeping back into the industry	Last month I saw Fin Taylor’s new standup show When Harrassy Met Sally, which made light of sexual harassment, the gender pay gap and the #MeToo movement. His intention might well have been to make us laugh, but I found little to enjoy in this Jim Davidson tribute act. What kind of reactionary drivel was I being subjected to in the name of comedy? 
FEB26	Marie Antoinette’s showbiz image shone a spotlight on royal excess. Now it’s Meghan Markle’s turn	The name Marie Antoinette is always evoked when hugely privileged women flaunt their wealth. Unlikely myths still surround the aristocrat who was Dauphine of France at 14 and Queen at 18, including her apocryphal suggestion that starving peasants running out of bread should “eat cake”.  While all members of Marie Antoinette’s court were living it up towards the end of the 18th century, the populist pamphlets singled her out for allegedly obscene extravagances. Occasional kind acts towards the poor, including founding a home for unmarried mothers, failed to save her from the guillotine when the French Revolution finally swept the Ancien Régime away. 
FEB26	George Pell’s conviction shows how ignorant the Catholic Church is to its child abuse problem	To describe the results of the Catholic Church’s first global summit on clerical child abuse as disappointing would be an understatement of truly sublime dimensions. It should, at the very least, have produced a universal law enforcing zero tolerance and dismissal from the clerical state of priest abusers and the bishops who protect them.
FEB26	How the Independent Group blew British politics wide open – and what they should do next	In under a week and a half the new Independent Group of MPs has changed the course of British politics. On whatever side of the fence you sit, that is a stunning achievement.  Almost one in five voters are now said to be considering voting for a nominal Independent Group party. The creaking door of Labour’s move towards a second referendum has been given a shove – its familiar caveats notwithstanding. And they have coaxed more Tory MPs to their midst in a matter of days than the SDP-Liberal alliance managed in several years of trying. Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston are exactly the type of Conservatives one would handpick for any new alignment. In short, this is a big deal.
FEB27	Why are the Democrats the only adults in the room at the Michael Cohen testimony?	27 February 2019 will go down in the chronicles of history as a turning point for what has become the fiasco of the Trump presidency. As Michael Cohen appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, most Americans expected to hear about the intricate inner workings of Donald J Trump’s businesses and personal life over the last decade. What most Americans got was exactly that —if they listened to the portion of the hearing when Democrats were in control of the floor. Cohen’s opening statement could best be described as a slow yet deadly injection of polonium into the White House’s main artery. Every second of the 30-minute-long opening dialogue seemed to raise the temperature within the hearing room by another tenth of a degree, and I’m sure the same could be said about the president’s Hanoi hotel room in Vietnam.
FEB27	The Michael Cohen hearing was the perfect metaphor for the maggot-eaten rotting corpse of the Republican party under Trump	Today the president finally made it to Vietnam (his bone spurs must have healed) but Trump’s second meeting with Kim Jong-un was far from the central focus on the day.  8,756 miles away, the president’s ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen gave his second day of testimony but his first day of public testimony. To say it was a circus is greatly disrespectful to circuses. Circuses bring joy. No one got joy from today’s circus.  
FEB27	India and Pakistan edge towards conflict – but sense should prevail	When a car bomb killed 46 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir a fortnight ago, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised a “jaw-breaking response”.  He was as good as his word, and it has now been delivered, breaking plenty of bones. India claims to have killed “a very large number” of Islamist militants in a training camp in the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir, a territory that has been disputed since the British left the subcontinent in 1947. The group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack on the Indian troops, and have now found themselves losing some of their own. It marks the first aerial bombing in the region since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971. It may not be the last of the violence in this region, newly agitated by a rise in Islamist activity, which has overlain ancient religious, national jealousies and superpower rivalries. It marks a new front in the war on terror.
FEB27	Outsourcing is a scourge on our society – but workers are now fighting back	The ever changing nature of our labour market has dramatically altered the relationship between employee and employer. The old model of employment no longer exists, workers are now often exploited through tiers of contractors, each one taking a slice of the profit leaving outsourced workers with the bare minimum.
FEB27	John McDonnell’s promising comments show there is hope left for a Final Say referendum	A politician declaring that they are “moving closer” to something usually means very little. It is a form of words often deployed to suggest that they would like their interviewer, and readers, as appropriate, to form the view that they are indeed agreeing with them, while not actually committing themselves to anything remotely specific: a weaselly device.

So when the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tells the Evening Standard that Labour is now “moving towards” a second referendum on Brexit, those few scant words carry more weight than they might usually.
FEB27	A parade of ritual votes solves nothing and leads Britain towards an inevitable Brexit delay	By the time MPs voted on Wednesday evening, the drama had been played out. All that was left was the ritual of three votes, the outcomes of which were not in doubt. The Labour and Scottish National Party amendments were defeated, and Yvette Cooper’s amendment, designed to reinforce the timetable for future Brexit votes set out by the prime minister, went through as the government chose not to oppose it.  The drama happened on Tuesday, when Theresa May finally accepted the reality that the House of Commons will block any attempt to take the UK out of the EU without an agreement. 
FEB27	Donald Trump has many flaws, but he deserves credit for his surprising success on the Korean peninsula	Donald Trump, by common consent, is not an especially likeable man. This applies as much to his politics as his personality, though he obviously enjoys a deal of support in some quarters of American society, sufficient to deliver the White House to him in 2016. Even so, the reaction of most progressives to anything Mr Trump does is that of revulsion, horror and bewilderment. This is usually correct. However, the president’s audacious initiative to make peace with North Korea – surprising as it has been to some – is one of the few unalloyed positives to emerge from the Trump administration.
FEB27	I've resigned from my position in the Conservative party over Brexit - we have let Britain down	On 13 February, I stood down as deputy chairman of the Cumbria Conservative party. I did this because I no longer feel able to act, in all conscience, as an advocate for the Conservative party. In 2016, the prime minister’s first speech on the steps of 10 Downing Street led me to become active within the Conservative party. Her emphasis on social cohesion and social mobility inspired me, but also I was motivated to join because of what I have always seen as Conservative values – a place in the world where we punch well above our weight, pragmatism over ideology, managerial skill, leadership courage and an unswerving commitment to support business and develop the economy, which our public services all depend upon. The past two years have led me to question whether these are merely ideals, because they are certainly not evident in practice.
FEB27	Sadly, the vote to block Trump's 'emergency' means nothing. Democracy in America is on the verge of collapse	America is at the edge of a deadly precipice from which it will be impossible to return.  While the democratic majority in the House of Representatives voted yesterday to block Trump’s declaration of a national emergency, it is highly unlikely that there will be enough support in the Senate to create a veto-proof majority. This means that Trump will get to use his very first veto to block Congress’s Resolution and continue with his fabricated national emergency. A fake emergency that numerous right-leaning media outlets and pundits are complicit in perpetrating. 
FEB28	As I watched Michael Cohen being questioned, I was reminded of what happened when I sued Donald Trump	When I was blocked by President Donald J Trump on Twitter in 2017, I didn’t think much of it. In fact, it felt silly and surreal that a man in the highest office in the nation was so concerned about silencing a comedian on social media. It was only later, after I was contacted by the Knight Foundation about a lawsuit forcing him to unblock his critics, that I realised the true extent of what I had become a part of. President Trump’s entire life centres around protecting himself and surrounding himself with people to protect him. Now, the majority of Republicans in Congress are using their own words and reputations to shield the president from harm.
FEB28	Imran Khan extends the hand of diplomacy – but India’s far-right are spoiling for war	“All wars in history were miscalculated. With the sort of weapons we both have, can we afford any miscalculation?” Those were Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan’s words to India yesterday. While the world’s attention was focused on nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, one of the oldest and most unpredictable nuclear relationships has flared up: India and Pakistan. India’s recent airstrikes deep inside Pakistani territory, and Pakistan’s downing of Indian fighter jets, may become the subcontinent’s “Archduke Ferdinand” moment.
FEB28	Attacking Ariana Grande for headlining Manchester Pride is ridiculous. The LGBT+ community need allies like her	Ariana Grande has responded publicly after facing criticism for accepting an offer to headline Manchester Pride later this year. Posting a screenshot from the iPhone Notes app, Grande said she “wanted to chime in” after seeing “many people” discussing the issue. Even before Grande was officially announced as a headliner, Manchester Pride faced accusations that sky-high ticket prices were likely to make the event less inclusive. Firstly, Grande addressed the ticket prices for Manchester Pride, saying they are not in her control.
FEB28	Our research has revealed DNA risk markers for suicidal thoughts – and could help change health policy	More than three-quarters of a million people take their own lives every year, to devastating personal, social and economic cost. Recent research has detailed the strong connection between suicide and mental illness, particularly depression. Past studies have also shown that those who have lost a relative this way are more likely to consider suicide. This paints a complex picture of suicide as something that has been shown to have both environmental and biological causes.
FEB28	India and Pakistan edge towards conflict – but sense should prevail	When a car bomb killed 46 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir a fortnight ago, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised a “jaw-breaking response”.  He was as good as his word, and it has now been delivered, breaking plenty of bones. India claims to have killed “a very large number” of Islamist militants in a training camp in the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir, a territory that has been disputed since the British left the subcontinent in 1947. The group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack on the Indian troops, and have now found themselves losing some of their own. It marks the first aerial bombing in the region since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971. It may not be the last of the violence in this region, newly agitated by a rise in Islamist activity, which has overlain ancient religious, national jealousies and superpower rivalries. It marks a new front in the war on terror.
FEB28	John McDonnell’s promising comments show there is hope left for a Final Say referendum	A politician declaring that they are “moving closer” to something usually means very little. It is a form of words often deployed to suggest that they would like their interviewer, and readers, as appropriate, to form the view that they are indeed agreeing with them, while not actually committing themselves to anything remotely specific: a weaselly device. With Labour and Brexit, though, the usual rules of political combat are altered. The slightest nuances in meaning from the lips of the leadership are carefully and deliberately measured, such is the party’s delicate balance, and crumbling unity, on Brexit. So when the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tells the Evening Standard that Labour is now “moving towards” a second referendum on Brexit, those few scant words carry more weight than they might usually.
FEB28	The army’s marketing drive is a cynical, calculated ploy to exploit Britain’s most vulnerable young people	This week the Defence Committee blasted “failed” veterans mental health provision. As a veteran and PTSD sufferer – and former defence journalist well acquainted with the limits of MPs’ scrutiny committees – this is refreshing. Yet their report does not go deep enough. It looks at what happens to us after service, but less so at what happens at the start of the military production line. Once again truly critical commentary has been left to those outside government.  A new report entitled Selling the Military, launched yesterday, says what neither committee nor government will say. It slams military recruitment advertising for targeting groups, particularly disadvantaged young people, who are likeliest to suffer precisely the kind of adverse outcomes detailed in the committee report.
FEB28	Society is still failing in its duty of care to children in detention	The report of the inquiry into the sexual abuse of children in custody is yet another cause of frustration that so much of our political and media attention is focused solely on Brexit.  There are so many things wrong with Britain today that are barely affected by whether we are in or out of the European Union. Some of the hardest problems to solve are those that affect marginalised and stigmatised groups – rough sleeping has recently started to be discussed because it has reached levels that cannot be ignored, but so many difficult subjects, such as mental illness and the state of our prisons, are easier to put out of mind. 
FEB28	I’m sick of MPs like Sarah Newton defending the DWP over people’s actual wellbeing	Three days ago, Tory MP and Department for Work and Pensions minister Sarah Newton demanded that people stop blaming the DWP and personal independence payments/work capability assessments for suicides. She said the same applied to the utter, incompetent (surprise, surprise) mess of universal credit.
FEB28	Will testing drugs really make users safer?	Could Louella Fletcher-Michie’s death from a drug overdose have been prevented? It is certainly possible. Her story, like all the others, is an individual case with its own particularities, but we do know how to make the chemical pursuit of fun safe.
MAR1	I wanted to hear interesting conservative ideas at CPAC. Instead I'm being told about Stalin stealing hamburgers	It's stunning to see the low depths the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) occupies in the Trump era.  Once considered a premier political gathering, it was typically viewed as a place where the renegades in the conservative movement made sure those in power knew that people were watching. The first CPAC featured Ronald Reagan, and was seen as a shot across the bow to the more establishment Republicans like Richard Nixon. 
MAR1	On the streets of Pakistan people are resisting old-school warmongers to call loudly for peace	I woke up in Islamabad to the knowledge that Pakistan may be on the brink of war. Not an incredible reality given that it is Pakistan. However, my reality living and working in Islamabad differs from the Pakistan presented in the news cycle. Most days when I’m not reporting I’m frequenting Aussie-style coffee joints for a flat white, hiking on the Margalla Hills and enjoying dinner in the city’s bustling restaurant scene. But now I was faced with the prospect of war. Pakistan and India had engaged in airstrikes deep into each other’s territory. What stood out this time was that never before had either country veered beyond the infamous Line of Control. Not since 1971 has there been such an escalation in tensions between the warring neighbours: the stakes were high and I knew the alert was considerable. As a reporter in this region, it is very important to acknowledge the importance of perceptions. This is a nation living on the edge.
MAR1	Mea Culpa: footing the bill for breaking Muphry’s Law	The hazard of criticising other people’s writing is that you are bound to fall foul of Muphry’s Law: “If you write anything criticising editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.” (Muphry being a humorous misspelling of Murphy, whose own law holds that “anything that can go wrong will go wrong”.) That is what happened to me last week. I said, referring to a sentence accusing Donald Trump of “landing the American people with a $5bn check that somebody else was meant to pay”, that we meant “cheque”. In fact, the “check” there was a different Americanism, and we meant “bill”. Thanks to Paul Edwards and others for pointing out my mistake.

MAR1	Young people demanded we debate climate change in parliament – and only a handful of MPs turned up	Climate change is the biggest issue facing our planet. Extreme weather hit every populated continent in 2018, killing, injuring and displacing millions.  
MAR1	Has the #MeToo campaign left feminists incapable of forgiveness?	When a high-profile man is publicly accused of sexual impropriety, can they ever be forgiven?  Anyone found guilty in a court of law serves their sentence and is entitled to return to a normal life. Post #MeToo, a new moral code seems to be emerging, one that does not easily accommodate forgiveness or offer a second chance. Some campaigners think that men guilty of sexually inappropriate behaviour – even though they are not charged with any crime – should be denied work and held up as an example to others. 
MAR1	One of the oddest consequences of Brexit? That our hapless transport secretary has survived this long	Chris Grayling, MP for Epsom and Ewell and, for the moment, secretary of state for transport, does have an unfortunate name. Google the phrase “failing Grayling” and more than a million results are retained. It is a headline writer’s dream, so much so that Mr Grayling’s aides have contacted the media to request that they no longer use it – an elementary, counterproductive error in the spin doctor’s book of dos and don’ts. In a way, though, it is quite fitting that failing Grayling should employ a failing press team as well. If Mr Grayling’s only problem was the mischievous attentions of media folk he would not have much cause for concern, and nor would the government. Mr Grayling has the far more unfortunate habit of creating chaos and failure in every department that has the misfortune to have him dumped in it. The latest double whammy of failures is the £33m that the treasury is having to hand over to Eurotunnel after Mr Grayling botched contracts for cross-Channel capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The ferry scheme has already suffered double humiliation: a valuable contract was handed to a company with no ferries, which then walked away when its principal financial backer pulled out.
MAR1	My terror of being fat drove me to anorexia, but I was rescued by the thrill of fighting for a cause	I had always known I was too much. Much too big and too loud and too there. I was extra sensitive, attuned to the emotional climate around me at all times, and it seemed like I was a conductor for any and all feelings that I sensed in others. It was at about five years of age that I felt this emotional too-much-ness becoming embodied and externalised. It was as if my body became the signifier for the dis-ease in my inner world; I saw myself as too fat and fleshy. The problem became physical, and, thus, tangible.
MAR2	The outcome of Brexit now depends on Geoffrey Cox, Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds	We are now 10 days from the decisive vote on leaving the EU. On Tuesday 12 March the House of Commons will vote again on Theresa May’s Brexit deal – this time with a legally binding explanatory document attached.  If MPs approve the deal, Britain could still leave the EU on 29 March, as planned. Parliament would have to pass a bill to put the terms of the withdrawal agreement into law, but that can be done in double quick time if there is a majority for it. 
MAR2	Jeremy Corbyn is right that MPs must give the people a Final Say on Brexit – here’s how	Politics is about choices. And over the past two years Theresa May has made all the wrong ones on Brexit.  She laid down irresponsible red lines at the start of the negotiations, narrowing our options to those acceptable to the Brexiteers and the DUP. And, after suffering the biggest defeat in parliamentary history, she chose to recklessly run down the clock rather than seek a credible way through the impasse.
MAR2	The Top 10: Titles changed for foreign markets	This has been in the Listellany production line since about 1998, when JK Rowling’s first book was published in the US as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. A lot of good nominations for this one, so I’ve made it a Top 20. In no particular order... 1. The Golden Compass. US title of Northern Lights, by Philip Pullman. Nominated by Tom Railton. Really annoys some people. “The title of the His Dark Materials trilogy was intended to be The Golden Compasses (another Paradise Lost reference) but Pullman changed his mind; the US publishers preferred the earlier title, thinking it described the alethiometer,” said John Oxley. 
MAR2	India and Pakistan edge towards conflict – but sense should prevail	When a car bomb killed 46 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir a fortnight ago, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised a “jaw-breaking response”.  He was as good as his word, and it has now been delivered, breaking plenty of bones.

It marks a new front in the war on terror.
MAR2	The gay victims of the Holocaust must not be forgotten – their stories are a reminder of today's inequality	Britain has just celebrated LGBT History Month, a much-needed occasion for a community that has lived through a troubled history and is only just beginning to receive true acceptance. Conspicuously absent from many discussions, however, are the stories of the Holocaust’s LGBTQ+ victims. The persecution of gays and lesbians during the Third Reich has only recently started to receive proper historical appreciation after decades of erasure and suppression, and yet the LGBTQ+ community still remains largely ignored within our popular consciousness. As the world finds itself gripped with the rise of far-right forces, remembering the Holocaust cannot merely belong to the history classroom, but must have paramount importance in everyday life. We must also read about Nazism’s forgotten gay victims, because their story and subsequent erasure shed so much light on problems that persist to this day.
MAR2	How the UK economy has wronged young people for decades	Conditions for young people in the UK are bleak. Young people are more likely to be unemployed than older workers, and are more likely to be in low-paid jobs when employed. National minimum wage laws allow lawful discrimination against young people as they mean a young worker can be paid less than those over the age of 24 for doing the same job. Young people have worse pension opportunities than previous generations and suffer from a housing market characterised by high rents and purchase costs. They are also paying record levels of tuition fees for university, as well as spending more on accessing training and skills in a system of provision that is increasingly driven by profit.
MAR2	After his disastrous spell as justice secretary, why is Chris Grayling still in the cabinet?	Your assessment of Chris Grayling’s time as justice secretary does not do full justice to its horrors. His mania for privatisation not only resulted in the significant contracting out of probation services, but he also ran down staffing levels (from which the system is still suffering) and urged longer sentences, both no doubt to create greater scope for further privatisation of an already struggling system. He even had plans (scrapped by Gove, as with other Grayling “innovations”) for American-style mega prisons. He imposed petty if not spiteful constraints on prisoners’ rights, and altogether he set penal policy back to a much less enlightened age. Not content with all that, and with little understanding of the law, he interfered negatively with the work of judges and the judicial system in a number of ways, not least restricting access to legal aid – the cornerstone of a system of fair and equal justice for all.

MAR3	Less of The Canary and more Marx: How Labour should deal with the conspiracism in its midst	Long before #MeToo and the current craze for veganism, Hollywood legend Paul Newman compared marital infidelity to greedily wolfing down a takeaway hamburger when you’ve got steak at home. Yet a section of the Corbyn left is guilty of roughly the equivalent political error. Here we are, legatees of the greatest minds the socialist and social democratic traditions have produced over the last two centuries, from Marx, Luxemburg and Gramsci to Keynes, Crosland and Rawls.
MAR3	It’s about time schools offered classes on menstruation. It would’ve saved me a world of pain when I was a teenager	A young person I spoke with in my other job as a youth worker confided in me about her periods and how they were causing her hideous pain each month. She told me that she was passing enormous blood clots and soaking a sanitary towel so frequently she was unable to make it through a lesson at school.
MAR3	Until people can eat, wildlife will decline	In Mirera village in Kenya, farmers are threatening to kill scores of wild animals that have been invading their farms, unless authorities contain them within two weeks. In Laikipia county, there are fears of food shortage following destruction of crops by elephants and increasing concern over wildlife-related deaths. These are not isolated incidents. Across the world, a slow creep of smallholder and mega-farms is taking place, with agriculture moving into lands that were formerly wildlife range. As more humans encroach on wildlife sanctuaries, deaths on both sides are increasing, with wildlife locked in a battle it cannot win. While AK47 laden poachers are often framed as the chief threat to the wildlife of the world, a far more mundane risk needs to be addressed: the troubled co-existence of farmers and wildlife.

MAR3	Eurovision has turned into a ‘pinkwashing’ opportunity for Israel – the LGBT+ community should boycott it	The exploitation of LGBT+ identities for public relations purposes – so-called “pinkwashing” – is nothing new. But the state of Israel, long one of its worst proponents, appears to be taking pinkwashing to the next level as it prepares to host the Eurovision song contest in May. Ever since adopting its official nation-branding programme “Brand Israel”, in 2005, the instrumentalisation of queer rights and a liberal gay lifestyle has been a key plank of Israel’s propaganda campaign.
MAR3	Please, let's stop using the term ‘smiling depression’	There they were, all my depressive symptoms laid out in front of me – with any validation I should have felt completely overshadowed by how uncomfortable the term “smiling depression” made me feel.  New research reveals up to 40 per cent of people suffering from depression appear happy and upbeat on the outside, but internally feel hopeless and low – with Google searches for this depressive state, otherwise known as “smiling depression” dramatically increasing this year.
MAR3	Woody Johnson, we’re right to be wary of chlorinated chicken. It’s too late for the US, but not for Britain	We should all listen very carefully to Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK. He claims that criticism of US agricultural standards are “smears” fabricated by people “with their own protectionist agenda”. Well, those protectionists would be Brexiteers and Trump supporters. Remainers are not protectionists: they understand, I think, the value and breadth of the EU trade body. So, Johnson fails right there.
MAR3	Corbyn shouldn't be scared about a Final Say referendum putting off voters in Labour heartlands	New opinion polling by YouGov in the midlands and north of England reveals greater support for giving the people a Final Say on Brexit than some of Jeremy Corbyn’s advisers may fear.  The poll finds that three-quarters of voters in these “Labour heartlands” who express an opinion support the party’s policy – significantly strengthened by the Labour leader this week – of putting any Brexit deal to a new referendum. Among voters who currently intend to vote Labour, the level of support rises to 84 per cent.  
MAR4	Towns like mine needed a game changer from Theresa May. What we got was an insult	Today’s launch of the Stronger Towns Fund should have been so positive. For the first time, after decades of neglect, the government has recognised that the current settlement doesn’t work for our nation’s towns and has not done so for some time.  For over four decades towns have watched as good jobs disappear, only to be replaced with low-paid insecure work. When investment was made available it went to the cities in the hope the benefits would trickle out to towns. Largely, they didn’t. In towns across Britain the loss of those good jobs has cost us spending power and footfall, leaving our high streets struggling, our transport networks decimated and our populations ageing rapidly as young people increasingly move away looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
MAR4	I spent three days listening to a smouldering ash heap of Trumpian shills at CPAC. The GOP's future looks even worse than we thought	I lost three and a half days of my life at CPAC so you didn’t have to. I arrived Wednesday afternoon at National Harbor (a short 40-minute Uber ride from Washington DC) for CPAC. It was my first conservative political action conference and I had somehow convinced myself that this trade show with white nationalists (Faith Goldy was there but not speaking, so that’s something) would be fascinating and enlightening. 
MAR4	From Shakin’ Stevens to Dr Karl Kennedy, we can learn so much from our celebrity crushes	Yesterday, writer Tim Carmody asked Twitter to share its most formative, life-changing celebrity crushes (revealing that his own were, variously, Whitney Houston, Svetlana Boginskaya, Nigella Lawson), and the thread immediately went viral. Hundreds of people shared their undying devotion to all the hormone-soaked 1990s classics: Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman; Keanu Reeves in most things; pretty much all of New Kids on the Block.
MAR4	Be honest, Sajid Javid — we have the money to tackle knife crime but your party would rather spend it elsewhere	The home secretary, Sajid Javid, says that the present wave of knife crime “can’t go on”, although his apparent confidence is contradicted by the reality of a problem that shows no sign of abating. Statistics from a range of agencies paint a bleak picture.

MAR4	There’s more to Libya’s recent show of peace and unity than meets the eye – here’s why	When the powerful east Libyan military commander general Khalifa Haftar announced his forces were marching south to conquer it (and its oilfields), the news was met with less than a shrug. Most updates from Libya have been eclipsed by other areas of the Middle East since the flow of migrants and refugees to Europe has largely spluttered to a halt and Isis has been ousted from its Mediterranean caliphate.
MAR4	Corbyn’s hatred of the ‘MSM’ is a Labour tradition – one that has always led to electoral failure	On the face of it, hearing a politician referring to the media as “hostile” and “critical” to the sound of rapturous applause feels like a particularly modern phenomenon. In a climate where political rallies see reporters jeered, heckled and sometimes physically accosted, it is easy to think each new attack on the “MSM” is the latest symptom of a thoroughly Trumpian, twenty-first-century disease. In the case of Jeremy Corbyn however, his words to gathered supporters in Broxtowe in late February echoed a mindset as old as the Labour party itself. By complaining about Sky News not asking about issues he thought worthy of a question, he exposed the unwelcome return of the kind of media hostility that has represented the party at its electorally weakest. This return to seeing the media as an enemy of the party’s cause is also not good news for anyone who wishes to see Labour return to government.
MAR4	We simply cannot afford to let knife crime continue like this – too many young lives are at stake	Rarely does much good emerge from a public panic, but the sheer scale and nature of street knife crime has rightly created a sense of urgency about the problem. There is even some intelligent, sensible, constructive debate about the best way to deal with the scourge. With so many young lives lost to sometimes apparently motiveless murder, it is easy to despair at why this is happening. The facts are stark. While the overall total of knife offences has risen by about a third in recent years, it has only returned to 2011 levels. What has risen to crisis levels not seen since just after the end of the Second World War is the number of fatal stabbings. These numbered some 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending in March 2018, with 20 recorded so far this year. The number of under-18s using knives to kill is up by 75 per cent in three years. NHS data indicates a 93 per cent rise in the number of children being treated for wounds caused by knives or other sharp objects since 2014.
MAR4	Britain’s insistence that autistic drivers declare their condition is another slice of breathtaking ignorance	My wife and I have known for a while that our son was likely on the autism spectrum. We went through the lengthy and somewhat tortuous process of securing a formal diagnosis (which confirmed it) with the aim of securing for him the support he needs to thrive as he moves into secondary education.  
MAR4	One year on, the Skripal poisoning case is still riddled with questions that no one wants to answer	One year on from events in Salisbury, an official version of what happened reigns supreme: “Russia did it.” This presumption is scandalously short on evidence and logic, but it survives thanks to some highly effective stonewalling by the British government and some apparent media compliance. The Radio 4’s Today programme last week spoke of “a weight of evidence [against Russia] that even sceptical observers thought was pretty damning”.
MAR5	Trudeau’s golden image has been tarnished by scandal – but was he making a rational call on SNC-Lavalin?	There are two overriding features of the Canadian economy, and we are seeing their impact on politics right now. One is the dependence on the US market; the other, the need to support the Quebec economy. The first has helped drive policy over the future of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, who faces charges in the United States of violating US sanctions on Iran. The second explains the response of prime minister Justin Trudeau over the charges faced by the engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.
MAR5	If Trump and his friends seriously cared about antisemitism, Ilhan Omar wouldn't be their priority	Imagine a serious reckoning with antisemitism in American politics. Fox News would stop inviting Sebastian Gorka, the Nazi-affiliated former aide to President Donald Trump, to appear on TV. Republicans would ask serious questions of house minority leader Kevin McCarthy. Remember when he warned Jewish billionaires would “buy” the upcoming election?
MAR5	These innocent American children were taken to Syria by their Isis sympathiser mother — now it's time to bring them home	The winding up of the last remnants of Isis in northeastern Syria is an important milestone in eliminating the so-called Caliphate, a purported heaven on earth that became a charnel house of death and destruction.   The battlefield is now down to approximately one square mile and Kurdish troops, assisted by European and American forces, are engaged in violent final battles. But this victory should not obscure the humanitarian disaster hidden in the fog of war in the northeast of the country.  
MAR5	India and Pakistan edge towards conflict – but sense should prevail	When a car bomb killed 46 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir a fortnight ago, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, promised a “jaw-breaking response”.  He was as good as his word, and it has now been delivered, breaking plenty of bones. India claims to have killed “a very large number” of Islamist militants in a training camp in the Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir, a territory that has been disputed since the British left the subcontinent in 1947. The group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack on the Indian troops, and have now found themselves losing some of their own. It marks the first aerial bombing in the region since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971. It may not be the last of the violence in this region, newly agitated by a rise in Islamist activity, which has overlain ancient religious, national jealousies and superpower rivalries. It marks a new front in the war on terror.

In Laikipia county, there are fears of food shortage following destruction of crops by elephants and increasing concern over wildlife-related deaths. These are not isolated incidents. Across the world, a slow creep of smallholder and mega-farms is taking place, with agriculture moving into lands that were formerly wildlife range. As more humans encroach on wildlife sanctuaries, deaths on both sides are increasing, with wildlife locked in a battle it cannot win. While AK47 laden poachers are often framed as the chief threat to the wildlife of the world, a far more mundane risk needs to be addressed: the troubled co-existence of farmers and wildlife.
MAR5	Tommy Robinson hammered on my door at 5am and brought a torrent of abuse in his wake – but he won’t shut me up	For the last few months, I have written about the methods used by “Tommy Robinson” to intimidate and harass those who dare to criticise him. I do this because he’s the most visible figure in a surging UK far right, feted by politicians and media figures alike. Tonight he paid me a visit. Twice.
MAR5	Banning students from LGBT+ learning is a travesty – the shame of being a gay Muslim still hangs over me	It is deeply disheartening to read that Parkfield community school in Birmingham has rescinded its decision to educate students about homosexuality. This LGBT+ initiative was part of a strategy to combat endemic homophobia in schools. However, the scheme was revoked following complaints by mostly Muslim parents, who withdrew their children aged 4-11 from the school in protest.
MAR5	Incompetent enough to rival Donald Trump, Chris Grayling could be one of the few Brits to break America	It took a while, but he’s pulled it off. Chris Grayling has done what every British act yearns to do, but so few achieve. He’s cracked the States. Yesterday, while he was playing hooky from a Commons debate about himself, the transport secretary featured huge in The New York Times.
MAR5	With this reactionary mess of a government, of course knife crime is worsening	According to Bernard Hogan-Howe, the shocking escalation in knife crime across Britain is a complex issue. The former Metropolitan Police chief is of course right, but this is a truth not convenient to base politics. According to the prime minister, the escalation has nothing to do with the reduction in the number of police officers since the Tories came into government back in 2010.
MAR6	As an Israeli American, I agree with Ilhan Omar much more than the US politicians weaponising antisemitism	While freshman Minnesota Congresswoman Omar’s alleged antisemitism has been dominating the headlines in the US in recent weeks, in Israel, the controversies have barely been reported on in Hebrew media, and you’d be hard-pressed to find many Israelis who even know who she is. Yet much of the attacks and condemnations she is facing originate in talking points and policies created by the Israeli right, specifically under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the last decade. Omar has made repeated claims in recent weeks – some not too carefully crafted — that Israel (a country that holds millions of Palestinians under violent occupation) has outsized influence on American foreign policy and that its lobbyists use money to maintain that support. 
MAR6	Why Republicans — including Trump supporters — should primary the president	Over the next year or so, before the Democratic Party settles on a nominee to take on Donald Trump for the presidency, half the country will be treated to primary debates, town halls, policy discussions, op-eds, legislative trial balloons, campaign platforms, and more. The other half, well … they get rallies. There’s a way to fix that. Donald Trump must be primaried by a serious opponent. And by more than one, if possible.
MAR6	Be careful before celebrating the recognition of this non-binary transgender author by The Women’s Prize for Fiction	When it was revealed this week that Freshwater, the debut novel of non-binary transgender author Akwaeke Emezi, was one of 16 books longlisted for this year’s Women’s Prize for Fiction, it initially seemed like a positive and inclusive move.  “It is a historic moment,” Professor Kate Williams, chair of the judges, said of Emezi’s place on the longlist. “They are an incredibly talented author and we’re keen to celebrate them.”
MAR6	These innocent American children were taken to Syria by their Isis sympathiser mother — now it's time to bring them home	The winding up of the last remnants of Isis in northeastern Syria is an important milestone in eliminating the so-called Caliphate, a purported heaven on earth that became a charnel house of death and destruction.   The battlefield is now down to approximately one square mile and Kurdish troops, assisted by European and American forces, are engaged in violent final battles. But this victory should not obscure the humanitarian disaster hidden in the fog of war in the northeast of the country.  
MAR6	Until people can eat, wildlife will decline	In Mirera village in Kenya, farmers are threatening to kill scores of wild animals that have been invading their farms, unless authorities contain them within two weeks.

MAR6	Calling Kylie Jenner ‘self-made’ is an insult to hardworking millennials	The newest Forbes rich list has named Kylie Jenner the world’s youngest self-made billionaire. Now just 21, Kylie had made her first million before she could even legally drink to her achievements, and has since racked up a 10-figure fortune by flogging her highly successful makeup line. But the backlash against Jenner’s “self-made” status has been fierce, causing Forbes to state they define a “self-made” rich lister as someone who has built a company or established a fortune on their own – technically true in Jenner’s case.
MAR6	The rise in knife crime could put Labour in power as the impact of Tory austerity is laid bare	Theresa May knows that the outcome of the Brexit process will be engraved on her political tombstone, but still hopes something else will feature: her record as six years at the Home Office. At the time, May appeared to defy political gravity by making a success of a difficult job that had provided the career epitaph for several of her predecessors. But now her record does not look so good. The Windrush scandal and her “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, continue to fester. Her senseless target to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year remains way out of reach.
MAR6	It’s time for the Irish pro-choice groups to return the favour and support Northern Ireland’s campaign for equality	Last May, the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment was carried out following a campaign by the largest popular movement the island of Ireland has ever seen. Ordinary people mobilised in their thousands to secure safe, legal and free abortion in Ireland. The referendum was passed by a two-to-one majority, with almost one-and-a-half million votes cast in favour, and legislation was enacted in January. The members of Alliance for Choice, the primary campaign group for abortion rights in Northern Ireland, played a major role in this, despite the fact its outcome would not benefit them directly. They attended marches, helped with canvassing, particularly in the border counties, and lobbied decision-makers throughout the island.
MAR6	The way we talk about trans athletes is a key part of making the world more accepting	Sport is one of society’s most powerful tools for bringing people together and it should be open to everyone, including trans people. However, in recent days, sport has become a divisive issue around trans people’s right to participate. Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen female athletes speaking out against trans women competing in sport, contributing to an environment of misinformation. The confusion and conflation of different issues reduces a complex topic to a dismissive debate on social media.   The reality is we know many trans people still feel unwelcome, or even actively excluded from playing sports. Much of the conversation we’re seeing today in the media and online is unlikely to help change this attitude. The conversation is currently being dominated by an overwhelming amount of bullying, minimising people to their physical bodies and using outdated stereotypes and abusive language. 
MAR7	As Paul Manafort goes down for 47 months, Americans need to face up to what this says about Donald Trump	"Lock her up! Lock her up!” Those words were regurgitated over and over again during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, directed specifically at his opponent Hillary Clinton. In fact, the chant remains one of the favorites at Trump rallies across the US, acting as a continuation of sorts to Trump's seemingly empty promises to "drain the swamp" and take on political corruption in Washington DC. The nation's eyes were focused on one particular courtroom in Virginia today, where a convicted criminal was just sentenced by a federal judge to a lengthy prison term. No, it wasn't Hillary Clinton, even though she had been on the receiving end of over six total years of investigations by Congressional Republicans. Instead, it was yet another member of President Trump's inner circle, his 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
MAR7	Trudeau could have stood with an Indigenous woman and against corruption — but today he showed us the ugly truth	Justin Trudeau’s “unique selling proposition” in the 2015 Canadian election was that he would usher in a new era of “openness and transparency”, “Real Change”, and “Sunny Ways”. He was going to “do politics differently”. And for a while, that image remained in the minds of many Canadians.
MAR7	We need to stop sexualising jihad – women like Shamima Begum are so much more than brides of terror	The UK has been gripped by a moral panic around the case of Shamima Begum and the problem of so-called “jihadi brides”. Internationally we are waking up to the role of women in jihadism – some even going as far as to suggest that women are the future threat from Isis. But is this just jumping on the Begum bandwagon when the role of women in jihadism has been misrepresented for years? The Bethnal Green schoolgirl, who at 15 left the UK to join Isis in 2015, wants to return to the UK. Begum’s case is a gauge of the public debate and the pervasive and problematic narrative of “jihadi brides” that detracts from the truth.
MAR7	Costumes, tantrums and telly: have we lost the real meaning of World Book Day?	I love books. But I kind of hate World Book Day. Not as much as my wife hates it, but we’ll come to that. The core aim is utterly noble: to provide all children with a book for themselves. When you consider that a survey in December 2017 found one in eight disadvantaged children in the UK do not have single book of their own, the need for such a scheme is obvious.
MAR7	Why Republicans — including Trump supporters — should primary the president	Over the next year or so, before the Democratic Party settles on a nominee to take on Donald Trump for the presidency, half the country will be treated to primary debates, town halls, policy discussions, op-eds, legislative trial balloons, campaign platforms, and more. The other half, well … they get rallies. There’s a way to fix that. Donald Trump must be primaried by a serious opponent. And by more than one, if possible.

MAR7	The handling of Windrush is so bad, you wonder if Chris Grayling accidentally spent a morning at the Home Office	One of the tragedies of the current turmoil is that it would be extremely unfair if this government ended up being judged entirely on its chaotic handling of Brexit. Because they’ve been shite about everything else as well, and it would be unkind and discourteous if all the other shite areas were overlooked. For example, 10 months ago they apologised for humiliating the Windrush citizens, and promised to investigate how it could possibly have happened, that a policy they boasted would create a “hostile environment” somehow managed to create an environment that was hostile in any way.
MAR7	Trump is trying to pay his way to an annihilation of Palestinian statehood, and an erasure of Israel’s crimes	“Palestine” has been compared to many things. The world’s longest colonial war, a “hell-disaster” – Churchill’s memorable epithet – and the site of Israel’s “war on terror”, a conflict in which we are supposed to believe that the Palestinians are playing the role of al-Qaeda or Isis or any other outfit which the west and its allies have helped into existence, and which Israel is going to fight on our behalf. But there are times when Palestine turns out to have been located in the Bermuda Triangle. The Palestinians disappear. They cease to exist. They are forgotten, irrelevant, outside the landscape of fear, pain, injustice and occupation that we once heard about so often. No one can imagine what has happened to these Palestinians. Like the aircraft and boats which strayed into the mythical triangle, they shouldn’t have been there in the first place. Sad to see them go. But it’s a mystery.
MAR7	There has been progress in the west – but across the world women still suffer	It is now, on International Women’s Day 2019, not quite a century since the first woman took her place in the British House of Commons. Other women, in Ireland, had their own elections, but, for political reasons, did not take part in the proceedings at Westminster, so it was Nancy Astor that made history in 1919 as MP for Plymouth Sutton. Even now, a hundred years on, we can still see the disparity of female representation among the people who make our laws – about two-thirds of MPs are men. Across the west, the persistence of the gender pay gap, the #MeToo phenomenon and some well-publicised cases of men still badly abusing positions of power demonstrates how much more there is to be done before women can truly claim to be equal citizens. There is, in other words, no room for complacency while employers fail to promote women on merit, pay them less, refuse family-friendly hours, and treat them as sexual conveniences. It would be foolish to underestimate the prevalence of such attitudes, even today. Britain, like many nations, may like to congratulate itself on the legislative progress it has made, as well as emblematic breakthroughs such as its two female prime ministers, but across great swathes of ordinary life women remain underrepresented, undervalued and underappreciated. Still, in western societies they at least have the opportunity to mobilise and agitate. Even in Trump’s America, as we have seen most recently in the congressional elections, having a misogynist in the White House does not preclude further progress in making sure women have a voice, loud and clear, in protecting their civil rights and calling out casual sexism or determined chauvinism.
MAR7	Last year’s International Women’s Day felt powerful and jubilant. So why no fanfare this year?	Without fail, every International Women’s Day the usual background din of internet trolls rumbles into a hot, frustrated crescendo: why do we need an International Women’s Day? Aren’t we satisfied with the equality women quite obviously have? Why isn’t there an International Men’s Day? From its roots as a socialist workers’ protest in New York in 1908, when 15,000 women marched against poor working conditions, low pay and overtime, women began to acknowledge a day of celebration and activism. In 1975 the United Nations officially recognised 8 March as a day of advancing the status of women worldwide.
MAR8	International Women's Day: The 10 women nobody wanted to hear about — and the truth behind their stories	Some stories get told more than others. It might be because there's more political interest, a celebrity has alerted us towards them, or because they're closer to home. We know that the stories which deserve our attention don't always get it. So on International Women’s Day last year, we launched a series called Forgotten Women to give a snapshot into the lives of women and girls who are often ignored. Living in some of the most difficult situations imaginable, 10 remarkable women have shared their stories since then. Some you will certainly know about; others you may not. From New York to Idlib, Rwanda to Pakistan, these are the narratives which were in danger of being buried and which we strove to shine a light on instead.
MAR8	Strange as it sounds, the Trudeau scandal is good for Canada — and for those Liberal 'sunny ways'	This week, someone who has spent a career with Canada’s ruling Liberals told me Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's latest troubles are unprecedented. What about it? I asked. His perceived political interference in a judicial matter? No, no, no, the person responded. It was the way that the justice minister and attorney-general at the time, Jody Wilson-Raybould, resisted what she said was repeated pressure from Trudeau and his staff.
MAR8	I'm far from a Donald Trump fan — but don't call me an 'enabler' when I recognise what he's done right	President Trump is an enigma. It's difficult to imagine any other president creating political divisions the way he has since 2015. And that's just among Republicans and conservatives.  The Never Trump movement sprang up early in 2016 when a small percentage of Republican voters made clear they would not support Trump in the GOP primaries. For some, that extended to the general election against Hillary Clinton. 
MAR8	Silicon Valley tech businesses give unfair advantages to men — and it's bad for the economy	I’m an anomaly. I’m a woman and I co-founded a software company. Earlier this week, my co-founder and I announced that having raised financing for our business to the tune of $12m, we are the world’s first technology company with gender-balanced share ownership. The founders, the shareholders, the decision-making, the investors are all 50 per cent male and 50 per cent female. This is a first in Silicon Valley and indeed the world - so it’s something we’re very proud of.
MAR8	Mea Culpa: automatic, systematic, hydromatic and problematic	In an interesting article about the decline of cash, we reported a survey that found “half of those polled said they would find living in a cashless society problematic”. It may be that this was the actual wording of the survey question, in which case I should address my curmudgeonly grumblings to Link, the cash machine company that carried it out.  But I suspect the survey used normal English, asking people if they would find living without notes and coins difficult. “Problematic” is one of those words imported from academia because people think that it sounds intellectual – although it reminds me of the words of “Greased Lightnin’” in Grease: “This car is automatic; it’s systematic; it’s hydromatic...”
MAR8	This bland world of safe spaces needs more glorious risk-takers like Magenta Devine	Magenta Devine – who died this week – was easily the most incredibly annoying person I’ve ever worked with. She was also the most talented – effortlessly cool and never less than the consummate professional on camera. No mainstream television presenter had ever looked like Magenta before she appeared on Channel 4 in 1987 – she had already honed her image (black bob, dark glasses, red lipstick) to perfection and it never altered.  Magenta was enigmatic, secretive and highly intelligent. She also managed to do excellent work in spite of her long-standing battle with drugs. 
MAR8	MPs should hear what headteachers have to say – not just for students but for their own sake too	Rarely can a pressure group have had a more baleful, almost passive-aggressive title as “WorthLess”. That headteachers, naturally not the most militant of groups, should feel it necessary to campaign for funding for the very basics they need in their schools is a damning indictment of the way the education system has been run. It seems that there is a funding crisis.
MAR8	Corbyn keeps trying to dodge a Final Say – he should realise we’re best served staying in the EU	It seems Jeremy Corbyn is sifting through the Brexit allsorts, desperate to find any alternative to the one he doesn’t like: a people’s vote. His latest dodge is to throw his support behind a Norway-plus option. 
MAR8	Google searches for International Men's Day are through the roof – the sexist society we live in can't even let women have one day	Among the wonderful tweets on my feed this morning celebrating International Women’s Day, was one announcing the fact that “International Men’s Day” is the most searched for term on International Women’s Day. My first reaction was “of course it is”. If you think this year is a one-off, I’m here to pop your bubble. The same thing happened last year. And the year before that, and before that, stretching back across the last ten years. A helpful Reddit user, R1zzles, even created a graph to illustrate the ridiculousness of it.
MAR8	Amber Rudd's racist comment is a stark reminder that today's feminism doesn't represent women of colour like me	Amber Rudd’s reference to Diane Abbott as a “coloured” woman during an interview on BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine Show has become the talk of the day - and rightly so. While her intentions may have been positive, her offensive wording indicates the serious lack of understanding of the experiences of a black woman in modern Britain.   "Coloured" is regarded as an offensive racial slur as it originates from a time when it was used to describe anyone who was not white and when racism was commonplace. It is reminiscent of the era of segregation and inequality in the US when black people were ordered by the police department to wait in separate rooms, use separate toilets, and sit in different areas on public transport - all labelled as "Coloured" to indicate they were for people considered less than, "other", due to their race.
MAR9	Jarrah was born a British citizen and our country did nothing to ensure his welfare	The death of Shamima Begum’s baby should be a moment for national reflection.  The home secretary, Savid Javid, who holds one of the most important offices of state, caved in to the hostility from the usual noisy quarters and stripped her of British citizenship. Within a few weeks of that decision, Shamima’s baby died in a refugee camp. This sad state of affairs speaks loudly about the sorry state of British politics. 
MAR9	Educating brothel children in Pakistan should be a priority	The call to prayer echoes across the ancient walled city of Lahore. Worshippers hurriedly make their way towards the centuries-old Badshahi Mosque, and in its shadow thrives a trade older than the grand mosque itself. Condemned by the devout and exploited by the elite, the sex workers of Heera Mandi, Lahore’s infamous red-light district, earn their living on the margins of society. Open doorways offer a fleeting glimpse into the realities of the women who live here, most of whom face a daily struggle to make ends meet.
MAR9	The Top 10: Most Impressive Predictions	I did terrible technology predictions a while ago. Here we are doing uncannily accurate predictions. What is surprising, given how many predictions humans make, is how few good ones there are. Thanks to Steven Panthera for the idea. Here we are, in chronological order.  1. “In that young man I see many Mariuses”: dictator Sulla of Julius Caesar, circa 82BC (Plutarch). “A traditionalist, Sulla meant Caesar would be as destructive to aristocratic interests as Marius, his populist rival. Caesar’s victory over Pompey ended the rule of the aristocracy and paved the way for the autocracy of Octavian/Augustus,” said Graham Kirby.

MAR9	The left-wing case for Brexit is becoming more ridiculous by the day	The logic of the Labour Party’s Lexiteers – proponents for a left-wing Brexit – ranging from Jeremy Corbyn to Caroline Flint, gets more tortuous by the day.   I’m going to quote a recent tweet by Flint as an example, because it’s a doozy. 
MAR9	The fate of the Five Star Movement will be a sign for the future of populism across Europe	As European elections approach, Italy’s populist Five Star Movement has been struggling to build on its early success. Punishing results in regional elections in Sardinia and Abruzzo, and the rise of party “rebels” against Luigi Di Maio’s leadership, have piled on the pressure. So has the 5SM totally lost its groove? In coalition with far-right party Lega Nord, 5SM’s problems are shown up perhaps most clearly when it comes to the environment, a campaign issue that initially brought them success. Little surprise then that there has been a sense of rage and betrayal from activists fighting the construction of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline between Apulia and Azerbaijian following the government’s green light for the project.
MAR9	The home secretary made the wrong decision about Shamima Begum – and her baby	Sajid Javid, the home secretary, cannot be held responsible for the death of Shamima Begum’s son Jarrah. We do not know why the baby died and so we cannot know whether he might have survived if he had been brought to the UK.  All we can say is that Mr Javid’s decision to block Ms Begum’s return to this country was wrong, and seemed to be driven more by his ambition to succeed Theresa May as prime minister than by a dispassionate assessment of his obligations under international law. 
MAR9	I agree with Chuka Umunna – let's build a horseshoe-shaped chamber for a new era of politics	I think that Chuka Umunna’s recently published pamphlet is the most interesting political document I have seen in a long time, not least the thinking on the case of the debating chamber. I have long argued that the refurbishment of the parliament buildings should be used as an opportunity to build a new non-confrontational chamber on a different site. This would also free up the refurbished building for other beneficial uses, including perhaps a mixed housing project and other valuable social and community spaces. The Commons chamber could then be turned into a tourist attraction where famous debates could be played out by actors, with tourists and other members of the public playing roles as MPs. Could also be quite a useful income stream.
MAR10	Only Jess Phillips can save the Labour Party – Corbyn would be mad to let her go	In the unlikely event that Jess Phillips hires me as her life coach, the first advice will be this: In the name of sanity, Jess, take a holiday. The moment the immediate Brexit crisis has passed, find a remote Greek island, laze on the beach with a trashy novel, drink too much retsina over dinner, blitz the boxsets in bed, lie in till 11am the next morning... and repeat daily for a minimum of two weeks.
MAR10	Jarrah was born a British citizen and our country did nothing to ensure his welfare	The death of Shamima Begum’s baby should be a moment for national reflection.  The home secretary, Savid Javid, who holds one of the most important offices of state, caved in to the hostility from the usual noisy quarters and stripped her of British citizenship. Within a few weeks of that decision, Shamima’s baby died in a refugee camp. This sad state of affairs speaks loudly about the sorry state of British politics. 
MAR10	The UK could be instrumental in the prosecution of President Assad for alleged war crimes	Despite an eight-year spectacle of violence, extensively documented by journalists, aid workers and even governments, the world’s most wide-reaching criminal court has failed to bring a single case against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.  Until now. This week, in a neat legal trick, a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers found a way of circumnavigating the major pitfalls that blight the International Criminal Court (ICC) to finally pursue justice.
MAR10	How a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could make life-saving drugs unaffordable for the NHS	The fight over access to the life-changing cystic fibrosis medicine Orkambi is emblematic of the challenge facing the NHS from ever-higher drug prices, as patients fall into the yawning gap between what the NHS can afford, and the price the US drug company, Vertex, is demanding.  This week, the Health and Social Care Select Committee hauled all the parties – Vertex, NHS England, and NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the body that decides on the cost effectiveness of a medicine) – over the coals in a bid to resolve a dispute that has lasted over three years.

MAR10	If you think individuals' actions can't solve our environmental crisis, you're wrong – here's why	I was asked last week for International Women’s Day who was inspiring me in 2019. My answer was a 16-year-old Swedish girl. If you don’t know the name Greta Thunberg, she’s the schoolgirl behind the fast-growing student movement, supporters of which are striking every Friday to highlight how much our governments are effectively sticking their fingers in their ears and humming every time anyone asks what we’re doing about our growing environmental crisis. The American movement Sunrise is on the same track. Students are leading the way in challenging their congresswomen and men on their environmental records and commitments. It’s easy to roll your eyes and talk about how that won’t change anything, but in the age of global instant communication, individuals have more clout than ever. Arguably, the Parkland survivors and March For Our Lives organisers have done more to highlight gun violence and hold lawmakers to account than decades of failed policies.
MAR10	As an expert in child sexual abuse, here’s my take on Michael Jackson's accusers in Leaving Neverland	Since Leaving Neverland – the disturbing documentary film about Michael Jackson and the nature of his relationship with two young boys – aired, many of Jackson’s fans have said they cannot believe their idol would commit the abuses alleged by the now adult men. But others watched horrified as stories from the 1980s and 1990s were recounted. Viewers asked: how could this have happened? How did the parents let their children get into such apparently dangerous situations? And why weren’t red flags raised at the time?
MAR10	If MPs want to put pragmatism ahead of ill-advised ideology, they will have to reject Theresa May's next Brexit deal	Theresa May’s Grimsby speech offered no new plan to break the Brexit gridlock. This week is crunch time for her deal and the speech only confirmed the need for parliament to chart a way through.  For months she has hammered home the message that passing her deal is “in the national interest”. But amid the endless analysis of textual shenanigans and parliamentary hullabaloo we have completely lost sight of what that means. If the deal passes this week it will soon become clear to all sides of the debate that it is the very opposite.
MAR10	When it comes to Brexit, no one even really knows what they’re fighting for any more	Listening at the weekend to the various white noise that passes for debate about Brexit in the run up to more ridiculous parliamentary votes on something or other to do with the Brexit mess, I had an out-of-body experience and came to a very simple, obvious conclusion: no one is even fighting over “Brexit” anymore – whatever that was. It’s as if shady street hawkers enticed people into a spangled glitzy-looking restaurant with promises of free roast beef, double pudding and singing waiters, and somewhere between the entrance and the table at the back the heating was switched off, the music stopped, the lights went out, the decor faded to a mottled grey, and now the customers are being persuaded to stay in the restaurant and fight over whether to eat the dusty old dried flower arrangement – or not. And they are going at it hell for leather.
MAR11	Tucker Carlson, no acceptable sentence begins with 'I'm not for child rape, I'm just saying'	Imagine being one of Tucker Carlson’s three daughters today. Imagine you found out that your dad, the Fox News host, went onto a controversial radio program in 2009 and spoke about your life at boarding school with someone who called himself Bubba the Love Sponge (yes, really) when you were 14 years old.  When she’s “in a dormitory-type setting,” the Love Sponge says in one recording, “and these little girls start to experiment around, next thing you know, you got a lesbian on your hands… I don’t got a PSP to play, I ain’t got nothing going on, I ain’t got my mom and dad here telling me they love me and tuck me in bed. So here’s Trixie, she wants to explore my body a bit, so hey, let’s go crazy.”
MAR11	What does the high school student suing CNN for $250m actually hope to achieve?	Young Nick Sandmann is reportedly to sue CNN for a whacking $250m over its coverage of his encounter with an indigenous American man. Rather than drawing a line under the affair, it is likely to further polarise opinion. The incident which has led us here happened in January. Sandmann and his schoolmates from Covington Catholic High School were in Washington for a pro-life march, "Make America Great Again" hats proudly atop their heads. By coincidence, the Indigenous People’s March was taking place at the same time and at some stage Sandmann came face to face with a Native American, Nathan Philips – the two seemingly at diametrically opposed ends of America’s social and cultural spectrum.
MAR11	Theresa May didn’t look like she’d done enough in Strasbourg to win Tuesday’s vote	Theresa May did not look like a leader who had won the breakthrough she needed. In Strasbourg, with her voice hoarse, her face drawn and her manner serious, she claimed to have secured legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. But she didn’t sound as if she believed it herself.  In fact, she has achieved significant changes. Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission president, expressed it rather better than she did. The new joint instrument – a document attached to the withdrawal agreement and of equal legal weight – would ensure that the Irish backstop “will never be a trap”, he said. If it were ever to be used in that way, it could be brought to an end.
MAR11	Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East? Netanyahu’s comments have shattered that illusion	Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in the headlines on Sunday, after declaring on social media that “Israel is not a state of all its citizens”. The Likud leader later doubled down, telling his cabinet that Israel is “the nation state not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people”. Netanyahu’s comments are the latest grim episode in an election season that will see Israelis going to the polls on 9 April. Just last month, the prime minister helped engineer an election merger that could see far-right party Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) enter the Knesset.
MAR11	The UK could be instrumental in the prosecution of President Assad for alleged war crimes	Despite an eight-year spectacle of violence, extensively documented by journalists, aid workers and even governments, the world’s most wide-reaching criminal court has failed to bring a single case against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.  Until now. This week, in a neat legal trick, a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers found a way of circumnavigating the major pitfalls that blight the International Criminal Court (ICC) to finally pursue justice.
MAR11	How a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could make life-saving drugs unaffordable for the NHS	The fight over access to the life-changing cystic fibrosis medicine Orkambi is emblematic of the challenge facing the NHS from ever-higher drug prices, as patients fall into the yawning gap between what the NHS can afford, and the price the US drug company, Vertex, is demanding.  This week, the Health and Social Care Select Committee hauled all the parties – Vertex, NHS England, and NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the body that decides on the cost effectiveness of a medicine) – over the coals in a bid to resolve a dispute that has lasted over three years.
MAR11	Dear Philip Hammond, ignoring the chaos of Brexit in the Spring Statement won’t make it go away	Wednesday’s Spring Statement will be sandwiched between two important votes on the Brexit deal. It’s been widely briefed that the chancellor intends to use the statement to offer MPs a choice: block May’s deal, and a £20bn war chest will be used to counter the economic hit of a no-deal Brexit; vote May’s deal through, and that money can be used to end austerity. This is a false choice. In either scenario, the chancellor is proposing spending an additional £20bn on a mix of public services, tax cuts and investment.
MAR11	Why dropping personal tax and paying everyone £48 per week is our best bet at reducing poverty	The new report released today by the New Economics Foundation represents a big leap forward in terms of addressing long standing issues with our tax system. It argues for the abolition of the personal tax allowance and its replacement by a “national allowance” of £48 weekly to everyone aged 18 or over with an income under £125,000 a year; and for the partial restoration of the value of child benefit – a rise of £4.20 a week for the first child, £2.70 for children after that.
MAR11	Theresa May's fight for survival is now measured in hours not days	With no small amount of regret, I must ask you to consider this column in the format of David Attenborough documentary, except that the “making of” bit at the end will have to last for at least fifty minutes of the full hour. It is now coming towards the end of, even by current standards, one of the maddest days in British politics, and there remains no cogent point that can be made about it. The only way to shed any light on events is to attempt to describe the impossibility of the light shedding process.
MAR11	Is it really a surprise that Phoebe Waller-Bridge worries about being a 'bad feminist'?	Do you fantasise about being Phoebe Waller-Bridge sometimes? I absolutely do. God, it sounds stressful though. The Fleabag and Killing Eve mastermind explained in a recent interview that she worries about falling into the trap of being a “bad feminist”. For her, as someone (rightly) held up as a fantastic example of modern feminism, there remains the fear that she might at some point fall into a pothole, and fail to be a “perfect spokesperson for the cause”. She added that she was aware that the central character of Fleabag, though honest, is far from perfect, which might invite criticism for the same reason.
MAR12	The sheer scale of May’s latest defeat makes a Brexit delay almost inevitable	The House of Commons has not broken its habit of voting against things, then. But, rather late in the day, the range of options facing MPs is narrowing. The scale of the defeat makes it hard for the prime minister to try to get her deal through a third time. She persuaded only 41 MPs to change their vote from the even bigger defeat in January, but she still needs 75 more MPs to change sides to get her deal through.  That means parliament is heading towards asking the EU to delay Brexit, which is, in effect, another way of not deciding, as the prime minister said rather pointedly after the vote. 
MAR12	As someone raised in Texas trailer parks, I don't hate Felicity Huffman — she's not the real problem	 On Tuesday, federal prosecutors charged 50 people—including actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman—with, among other things, bribing testing proctors and college officials at various elite institutions including Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown in order to secure spots for their kids. 
MAR12	The government’s impending porn ID checks are a danger to us all – here’s why	The government has shown, time and again, that its grasp on anything remotely digital has been severely lacking for quite some time now. Last year, the then digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) secretary launched his famous Hancock-up of an app, “Matt Hancock MP”. Aside from the unimaginative name, and the bizarre notion that individual MPs need apps dedicated to them, the real irony hit was when it was revealed that it breached UK data protection laws.
MAR12	The UK could be instrumental in the prosecution of President Assad for alleged war crimes	Despite an eight-year spectacle of violence, extensively documented by journalists, aid workers and even governments, the world’s most wide-reaching criminal court has failed to bring a single case against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.  Until now. This week, in a neat legal trick, a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers found a way of circumnavigating the major pitfalls that blight the International Criminal Court (ICC) to finally pursue justice.
MAR12	Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East? Netanyahu’s comments have shattered that illusion	Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was back in the headlines on Sunday, after declaring on social media that “Israel is not a state of all its citizens”. The Likud leader later doubled down, telling his cabinet that Israel is “the nation state not of all its citizens, but only of the Jewish people”. Netanyahu’s comments are the latest grim episode in an election season that will see Israelis going to the polls on 9 April. Just last month, the prime minister helped engineer an election merger that could see far-right party Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) enter the Knesset.
MAR12	I caused a Twitter storm by suggesting women should travel to Morocco – here’s why I stand by my statement	 “Helen, are u f***ing mentally retarded? Did u not even hear of the video?” “Knowingly leading western women to even the chance of possible slaughter...Wow! Here is the REAL #WarOnWomen. Straight from the #left.”
MAR12	Jeremy Hunt claims it was too dangerous to rescue Shamima Begum’s baby. That simply isn’t true	A baby was buried on the outskirts of a desolate camp in northern Syria last week. He died for the crimes of his mother, and because his government treated him as if he was complicit in those crimes. Few would have known him as anything other than the son of Shamima Begum, the infamous teenager who fled to Syria to join Isis with three school friends. But his name was Jarrah, and he was a British citizen. He lived for three weeks in desperate conditions before succumbing to a lung infection.
MAR12	Go back to your homes and prepare to vote – Cox's codpiece has left Brexit exposed and a second referendum is now inevitable	The codpiece has spoken. Barked, even. Geoffrey Cox, our voluble, Rumpole-esque attorney general, has killed Brexit. We should, for a moment, pause and reflect how lucky we are to have a politico-legal system that can allow for such independence of mind and thought and action. And here was I thinking that old Coxy was just a tame old mutt who’d do anything for a chocolate drop. The knighthood may not be in the post.
MAR12	Will Philip Hammond's spring statement end the Tories' shameless mafia tactics on public spending?	The government’s attempts to get MPs to vote for Theresa May’s now-terminal Brexit deal have resembled a mob boss trying to get the city to approve his new casino or the Feds to drop their money laundering investigation. At the Spring Statement on Wednesday, it’s Philip Hammond’s turn to make MPs an offer we can’t refuse. First, it was straightforward bribery. The prime minister effectively met Labour MPs in a secluded underground car park and offered them a suitcase containing £1.6bn in cash. Presumably in unmarked, non-sequential bills.
MAR12	Parliament has failed (again), so let the people decide Brexit with a Final Say referendum	One of the many excruciatingly painful ironies associated with Brexit is that a process designed to allow the British parliament to “take back control” has seen it utterly fail to do so.  The issue has proved so divisive, so difficult and so costly that it has jammed the usually smooth machinery of British political life. It has split parties; it has made enemies of friends; it has undermined businesses and destroyed jobs; it has rent families asunder; it has made hard-working Europeans in Britain feel unwelcome. The constitutional status of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Gibraltar are in jeopardy. All to no avail.
MAR13	Theresa May planned to defeat herself, then decided not to defeat herself by defeating herself, then lost. To herself	It was only ever meant to be a straightforward, plain vanilla farce, of the kind we’re all so very used to. Theresa May has spent the last three years saying “no deal is better than a bad deal”. She’s allocated £4bn of public money to preparing for no deal. And then, on Wednesday evening, she was expected to walk through the division lobbies and vote to rule out no deal.
MAR13	OK, so MPs don’t want a no-deal Brexit – but what do they want?	As expected, MPs voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but managed to make quite a drama of it. Theresa May didn’t want them to rule it out at all, but she was forced by Yvette Cooper, the alternative prime minister, to offer them a vote. She tried to limit her motion to ruling out leaving without a deal on 29 March, which would have kept open the option of a no-deal Brexit after a short delay of perhaps two months.  But the mood of the House of Commons was against half measures, and so MPs voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit at any time. Caroline Spelman, the Conservative MP who originally proposed the amendment, was persuaded by the government that this went too far and would restrict the prime minister’s room for manoeuvre. She tried to withdraw the amendment, but the rules are that any MP who has signed an amendment may put it to the vote, so Cooper stepped in. 
MAR13	Trump's 'amazing' jobs numbers are due to people like me working into their 80s and stockpiling fish antibiotics	I’m 49 years old and I don’t have anything saved for retirement. It’s hard for me to admit this publicly. I’m ashamed and more than a little bit afraid about what it means for my future.  The main reason for this is that for much of my professional life, I’ve been classified as an independent contractor. It’s a legal loophole in the US which allows companies to harness the labour of an individual, often on a full-time basis, without actually hiring them. This distinction enables companies to avoid offering workers’ benefits, even basic healthcare.
MAR13	The future of Brexit now hinges on securing a delay that allows for a Final Say	When it came, it was dramatic, and a huge relief. No-deal Brexit, so disastrous, is ruled out, and comprehensively. Though Theresa May dared not say as much, from her actions it seemed clear that she was still clinging to the notion that, someday, somehow, her deal will eventually win approval in the House of Commons. Her sole political technique is the “bounce”, and her only reliable ally the passage of time. Hence her taste for a hard deadline. Her subterfuge, such as it was, did not succeed. Albeit by a tiny majority – four – parliament, at last, shows signs of exerting its will, and, to borrow a phrase, taking back control. Ms May has been ruinously stubborn – ruinous to her own position, inviting defeat over and over again. That explains why she has been so reluctant to allow MPs to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Indeed, she has only recently relaxed collective cabinet responsibility to allow a free vote on her own, disingenuous version of ruling out a no-deal Brexit – one that explicitly ”notes” that the default position remains leaving on 29 March without a deal. The prime minister was still trying to resuscitate her dead deal – hence the trickery and loopholes in the government’s motion. It was transparent, and now her own cabinet minsters have defied her by abstention on the key vote. “Dead woman walking” is a phrase that comes readily to mind once again.
MAR13	The UN's treatment of interns is peak hypocrisy – poor young people are not a disposable workforce	In recent weeks, interns in United Nations offices around the world have been staging walk-outs, sit-ins, demonstrations and debates to reject exploitative and exclusionary unpaid internships. These events in Geneva, Bangkok, Brussels and Copenhagen are just the most recent of protests in years of campaigning calling for the UN to put its money where its mouth is. Every year, the UN plays host to thousands of interns around the world. Yet the majority receive no pay and have inadequate access to basic employment rights. Access to sufficient funds remains an unspoken requirement for internship eligibility at the UN, thus excluding many candidates based on their background. This shouldn’t be happening in 2019. It should be a given that internships are awarded on merit, without contingency on financial status.
MAR13	The UK could be instrumental in the prosecution of President Assad for alleged war crimes	Despite an eight-year spectacle of violence, extensively documented by journalists, aid workers and even governments, the world’s most wide-reaching criminal court has failed to bring a single case against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.  Until now. This week, in a neat legal trick, a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers found a way of circumnavigating the major pitfalls that blight the International Criminal Court (ICC) to finally pursue justice.
MAR13	Sexism aimed at public figures is holding back poor and black young women – our research proves it	Today’s teenage girls would like to become the leaders of the future and they are the leaders we need. They are inspired by social justice, climate change, and a diverse range of female role-models. They are also being put off pursuing these dreams by the vitriolic abuse they know they would suffer as women in the public eye. These are the findings from research conducted for the Gender and Education Association and Oxford Brookes University. We interviewed 50 girls aged 13 to 16 around the country, asking which women they view as good leaders and whether they consider themselves potential future leaders.
MAR13	Brexit has forced more needless austerity on Britain – Philip Hammond's ‘deal dividend’ is a pathetic sham	If you lot can just agree something, it’s going to be great because there’ll be a super duper shiny deal dividend! So said chancellor Philip Hammond, delivering his spring statement, the “mini budget” we used to get in the autumn.
MAR13	The EU complains that the UK doesn’t know what it wants. Now we can tell them – a second referendum	In our journey into this country’s future we plod on inch by inch. Parliament has rejected Theresa May’s deal and if no deal is taken off the table, the road towards Brexit will in effect have reached a dead end. With it, the fog will clear for those MPs who argue that they have to honour their constituencies’ EU referendum votes and/or their party manifestos.
MAR13	While Theresa May suffers humiliation in parliament, her chancellor has quietly offered a genuine route to Brexit	I have long taken the deeply unfashionable and politically naive view that Philip Hammond would make an excellent prime minister and leader of his party. He has his flaws, heaven knows, but they are much magnified only in the eyes of those who think an ideal leadership contest would comprise a choice between Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The latest votes, to rule out the ruinous no-deal Brexit, demonstrates he is far more in touch with the Commons and the country’s mood than his prime minister. Hammond has been long been resented by Theresa May for his dour refusal to spend money on her pet schemes, and, I suspect, she is resented by him for her economic illiteracy. He has now shown some superior political literacy.
MAR14	Strap yourselves in – we're heading for Brexit round three	Theresa May is barely in control, but she is going to try one more time to get her Brexit deal through parliament next week. The prime minister has been forced to accept that she cannot get Britain out of the EU on 29 March, so now she is trying to use the threat of a long delay to put pressure on MPs to finally agree to her deal. The deal that they have already rejected twice.
MAR14	No, Beto O'Rourke isn't the most progressive Democrat you've ever seen — and that might be a good thing	Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke became a Democratic star last year when he almost unseated Ted Cruz in a bid for the Senate, prompting speculation he might run for the presidency in 2020. Today, the 46-year-old from El Paso ended the guessing amid a social media flurry prompted by a fawning profile of him in Vanity Fair, releasing an announcement video that adds his name to the large field of contenders vying to be nominated by the Democratic Party to go up against Donald Trump. While it became commonplace to describe Beto as not only a rising Democratic star but also a rising progressive star during his near-miss Senate run, the left wing of the party is not uniformly pleased to have Beto in a field that already includes contenders with proven progressive chops like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. According to a line of harder-left criticism, if you look past Beto’s admittedly star-making rhetorical skills and, yes, undeniably good looks, his voting record shows little evidence of real progressive political commitments. Indeed, there is evidence that on some key issues for Americans, he’s somewhat uncomfortably out to the right.
MAR14	The future of Brexit now hinges on securing a delay that allows for a Final Say	When it came, it was dramatic, and a huge relief. No-deal Brexit, so disastrous, is ruled out, and comprehensively.

This distinction enables companies to avoid offering workers’ benefits, even basic healthcare.
MAR14	Brexit has finally broken the British political system	The British political system has existed, in a relatively similar form, for hundreds of years. Periodically, an issue will arise which causes a shock to the system, reform follows and then life returns to normal. Even the parliamentary buildings are a throwback to an earlier era, failing to have even enough seats for all 650 MPs now elected to the chamber. It is a parliamentary system which prides itself on its ability to be bomb-proof, immune to the temporary ebb and flows of popularism, providing strong and stable majority governments for generations. No longer. The old certainties feel far less permanent in the wake of Brexit. The spectacle of the House of Commons has become a regular fixture on our television sets, with the commons becoming the scene of passionate speeches and rousing argument. As the physical structure of the Houses of Parliament are repaired and saved from the ravages of old age, how can the political system it houses be saved? Has Brexit exposed cracks in the system, which signal its demise?
MAR14	The Bloody Sunday inquiry promised to give bereaved families closure. They're no closer to achieving it today	The historic inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings, one of the most violent, emotive and painful episodes of recent British history, began in March 2000, with a public promise that the truth shall be sought whatever the political consequences. Lord Saville of Newdigate’s investigation, seeking to answer how and why 13 civilians were shot dead by paratroopers on the streets of Derry, was then the biggest in British legal history and hugely controversial; it reopened old wounds and rekindled memories of a violent time when a part of the United Kingdom was effectively in a state of war.
MAR14	Even though they voted against it, MPs know a second referendum is the only way out of this Brexit mess	 Theresa May talks a lot about the damage to democracy that another Brexit referendum would do, seemingly oblivious to the damage she is doing to democracy herself. A prime minister whose flagship policy has won gold in the Biggest Defeat in Parliamentary History contest. Who inherited a Commons majority and lost it when seeking a specific electoral mandate for her version of Brexit. Who has lost control not just of parliament but of her cabinet. Who has lost the respect of fellow EU leaders who see someone out of her depth, unable to deliver what she promises, and unable to keep her word. Who is helping to reduce the UK, whose politics historically is respected around the world, to a global laughing stock. 
MAR14	Bloody Sunday is not over yet	It is now almost half a century since the Bloody Sunday massacre, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a protest in Derry against internment without trial. It led to 1972 becoming the worst year for deaths – 479 – during the three decades of the Troubles.
MAR15	If you want to know the shocking truth about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her scandals, here it is	There is a veritable dumpster fire of scandals currently embroiling the White House. President Trump has been accused of conspiring with a foreign government, obstructing justice, and violating campaign finance law, among other things that I cannot list in full because this piece can only run to 800 words.  Indeed, Americans are facing the most pressing threat to our democracy in modern times — but there is another, even darker scandal which seems to be vexing many of our establishment politicians and much of our media: namely, that women have some power now. 
MAR15	The New Zealand shooting video should never have been published by the media. It’s not just distasteful – it’s dangerous	You might think the media was – regrettably – sufficiently well-practised at reporting terror attacks by now. Yet today we have seen an extraordinary intervention by the prime minister, requesting that UK news organisations take down from their websites footage of the attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, which left 49 dead and many others fighting for their lives.
MAR15	Populism is at the heart of the Christchurch attacks	The New Zealand attacks, once again, are an attempt to radicalise religion and divide us. The far-right supporter who is alleged to have murdered 49 people in Christchurch publicly announced his hate for Muslims and immigrants. He also praised Donald Trump, saying he was a “symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose”, while his guns had the names of Christian leaders who had fought Muslims written across them. Populists are attempting to sow division between “us” and “them” – to create a culture war. We must stop this ideology now, before it grows out of control.
MAR15	As a Brit living abroad, I've watched Brexit unfold this week — and decided to delay my return	The recent vote by the government to push Brexit back has created more uncertainty for Brits living at home. It’s also left those of us living abroad feeling a little lost.  When I’m asked by my American friends to explain Brexit, I throw my hands in the air because I can’t keep up with the twists and turns. So rather than point them in the direction of data that could change on any given day, I laugh/cry at the comedy bits and cat memes that help to humorously summarise where things stand. But, as clever as they are, none of them can fully describe the damage the 2016 vote did — damage that has left me wondering if I’d want to move back to the UK any time soon.
MAR15	Mea Culpa: how to reduce the damage done by Donald Trump and Brexit	We reported yesterday that Donald Trump had come out against The Independent’s Final Say campaign – he said another referendum “would be very unfair to the people that won”. The report also mentioned the prospect of a US-UK trade deal and said that some commentators were “suggesting it would mitigate against the substantial economic damage” of Brexit. 
MAR15	The future of Brexit now hinges on securing a delay that allows for a Final Say	When it came, it was dramatic, and a huge relief. No-deal Brexit, so disastrous, is ruled out, and comprehensively. Though Theresa May dared not say as much, from her actions it seemed clear that she was still clinging to the notion that, someday, somehow, her deal will eventually win approval in the House of Commons.

MAR15	The US college admissions scandal didn't surprise me — I saw it from the inside	Lisa was on a rampage. In the weeks since she’d hired me to help her son with his college applications, the New York City mother had micromanaged every step of the process. Now, minutes after I’d emailed the student an edited essay, she was shouting at me over the phone. “I couldn’t believe Tyler’s draft! What do you mean, ‘it’s the best he could come up with’? 
MAR15	After Theresa May's disastrous week, you'd be forgiven for thinking her Brexit deal is dead – here's why you'd be wrong	Cabinet splits on Europe were embarrassingly exposed in last night’s Commons votes. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, was one of seven cabinet ministers to vote against delaying Brexit, minutes after urging MPs to support such a delay. Theresa May, no longer able to paper over the cracks in her imploding cabinet, had to rely on the good sense of Labour and other opposition parties to win a majority for a delay; most Conservative MPs opposed her in a free vote. After such a farce, and another torrid week for May, you might assume her Brexit deal is dead. But in the looking glass world of UK politics, it is not.
MAR15	Fraser Anning's attempt to blame Muslim victims of the New Zealand terror attack is all too familiar	The grief had hardly set in for the families and loved ones of those murdered in Friday’s terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, before Fraser Anning, the senator for Queensland, said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration programme which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” Just to rub salt in the wound, he added: “Let us be clear, whilst Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. Worldwide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”
MAR15	The whole world shares New Zealand’s sorrow over this far-right act of terror	“We were not a target because we are a safe harbour for those who hate. We were not chosen for this act of violence because we condone racism, because we’re an enclave for extremism. We were chosen for the very fact that we are none of these things, because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those that share our values, a refuge for those who need it.” New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spoke with enormous dignity, and with the sympathy of the whole world, in reacting to the terrorist atrocity in her normally tranquil country. We already know enough about the motives of those involved in the murder of at least 49 innocent people to conclude that this barbaric act was a product of hate, pure and simple.
MAR16	If you care about LGBT+ rights, you should be fighting for a second referendum	“What the hell does Brexit have to do with LGBT+ rights?” This is a question I often hear. My answer? A lot. Before the EU referendum in 2016, I wasn’t a campaigner. I followed the Brexit debate, but saved my opinions for the dinner table. After all, others who were far more experienced were on the case, and it was all going to be fine anyway, right?
MAR16	The climate strike is a source for hope – but new research shows it might be too late	The end of the world is no longer a fanciful hypothesis. It is the most plausible scenario. In the last week, the UN Environment assembly announced its finding that, even if the Paris Agreement targets were met, global temperatures would rise by three to five degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Worse, even if all carbon emissions stopped immediately, the Arctic would be 5 degrees warmer at the end of the century than in the period between 1986 and 2005. The Arctic, that “Ice Temple of the polar regions” as the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen dubbed it, is particularly sensitive to global heating. As the Cambridge polar researcher Peter Wadhams has shown, the “Arctic death spiral” is well underway. This ice will soon disappear, beginning with an ice-free September any year now.
MAR16	Tech giants must now use their power to fight racist hate online	Sajid Javid, the home secretary, reflected the common view in the wake of the killings in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he told the big tech companies: “Take some ownership. Enough is enough.”  Addressing Facebook, YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Twitter – on Twitter, ironically enough – he was right to identify their responsibility. Of course, the white supremacist who killed 49 people is the only person guilty of those murders. 
MAR16	How one of the biggest sporting tournaments in the US still revolves around our ugly English class system	They call it “March Madness”. US college basketball’s wildly entertaining championship tournament is one of America’s biggest and best sporting events. But it has a very English injustice at its core.  There’s nothing quite like the single elimination tournament featuring 68 teams. Every game counts, and the fans care deeply about them. This isn’t the FA Cup where commentators feel the need to constantly remind us of a “magic” that no longer exists. It’s self-evident. 
MAR16	The Top 10: Fictional bands	This list grew out of last month’s Top 10 songs by bands about being in a band, because I had several nominations for “Benny and the Jets” and ruled them out of order because Elton John is a solo artist not a band. Thanks to Adam Greves for suggesting this one.  1. Spinal Tap. Nominated by James Irwin, Tom Doran, Mark Brookes and others. Although you can buy their output, pointed out Patrick Hennessy. 
MAR16	From Felicity Huffman memes to an MP wearing an ankle tag, why does gay Twitter adore 'bad' women?	This week, US federal prosecutors charged 50 people over a $25m scheme that allegedly helped wealthy Americans buy their children’s way into elite universities. The stench of overt privilege, cheating and elitism certainly made the scandal worthy of front-page news coverage. But the alleged involvement of actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, who were among those charged, added the sprinkling of Hollywood glamour, setting the story further alight. 
MAR16	Fraser Anning's attempt to blame Muslim victims of the New Zealand terror attack is all too familiar	The grief had hardly set in for the families and loved ones of those murdered in Friday’s terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, before Fraser Anning, the senator for Queensland, said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration programme which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” Just to rub salt in the wound, he added: “Let us be clear, whilst Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. Worldwide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”
MAR16	After the New Zealand terror attack, the positive teachings of the Quran are a force for good in my life	In the aftermath of New Zealand’s deadliest ever terrorist atrocity, in which 49 people were killed and dozens more seriously injured, numerous unanswered questions have been brought to the surface. For example, has inflammatory, hateful rhetoric by certain politicians exacerbated anti-Islamic sentiment? Can we say that mosque attacks like these were inevitable given the growing far-right violence? What can we do to prevent our society fracturing further? As a young practising Muslim living in the west, the main question I am faced with, however, is how to react when terrorists murder individuals of my faith. Does the Quran teach me to take up arms and declare war or does it present a different solution entirely?
MAR16	A lack of international leadership contributed to the New Zealand terror attacks	I want to add the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to my list of international political leaders who are, in my opinion, complicit in the massacres at two Christchurch mosques because of their words, silences, actions and inaction with regard to promoting white supremacy in order to further their own political careers. The others I mention are Donald Trump, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. There are many others internationally playing this race-baiting game: Nigel Farage, Viktor Orban, Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen, to mention a few.
MAR16	The gilets jaunes in France give us a very important lesson about Brexit	The hi-vis vest was once the “must-have accessory” for politicians in the UK. You’ll have seen them. An aspiring cabinet secretary, on your local TV news. They were probably visiting a construction site, surrounded by cameras and an entourage. They are there, they say, to connect with ordinary people. Well, as is so often the case, the French had their own take on the place of the yellow vest in politics – and theirs involved a lot more passion and a rebellious twist (before being hijacked by more sinister and unsavoury forces). Now, as the gridlock at Westminster grinds politics to a halt, it is perhaps to France our politicians should look for lessons on how to get out of this mess.
MAR17	Western education has a lot to answer for when it comes to the Christchurch attack	The mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 people weren’t different. They weren’t different because the attacker had a manifesto outlining his depraved beliefs, they weren’t different because they happened at the hands of a white man in New Zealand, and they certainly weren’t different because they were streamed live from his phone. As a society, we seem to consistently distinguish Islamic extremism from “other” extremism. Truthfully, however, there is no “other” when it comes to extremes; there is no religion, no logic, and, indeed, no compassion.
MAR17	When WWF’s conservation looks like colonialism, it’s time for a new approach	Scores of innocent people have been beaten up, raped and murdered in a series of atrocities which were committed by guards funded by WWF and then covered up, according to an in-depth investigation released by BuzzFeed last week. Sadly, these revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Around the world, in the name of “conservation”, thousands of families have been forced into destitution with no recourse or appeal.
MAR17	Why football can open the door to overdue conversations about mental health	Mental health is an important topic in football, especially given the highly competitive nature of being a sports star in the public eye. I’m not sure how I’d feel if I had the weight of the nation’s happiness resting on whether I scored a penalty. But that collective happiness that penalty shots have the power to make or break can be used proactively. Our shared love of the beautiful game can also galvanise fans to manage their mental health more positively
MAR17	Tech giants must now use their power to fight racist hate online	Sajid Javid, the home secretary, reflected the common view in the wake of the killings in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he told the big tech companies: “Take some ownership.

MAR17	The real secret to becoming an ISA millionaire	One of the slightly irritating features of the run-up to the end of the fiscal year on 5 April is the plethora of adverts about ISA millionaires. The implied pitch is simple: you too can become an ISA millionaire if you fill out a form and send a cheque – or rather quite a few cheques. The reason is simply that the annual allowance for how much can be put into an ISA cannot be carried over into the next tax year, so there is a spur to do it now. That’s useful because we all put things off, but there is no magic path to millionaire status. The path is to save money while young and rely on compound interest to build up the capital. An ISA, or an individual savings account, is one of two main ways of doing so efficiently. The other is a pension plan.
MAR17	The success of Brexit is now in the hands of a small group of MPs – and not the ones you might think	What happened this week was that our departure from the EU has almost certainly been delayed. There is still a small chance we could leave in disarray in two weeks’ time, but that requires bad miscalculations by both sides.  So the choice now facing parliament is whether to leave on Theresa May’s terms after a delay of a few weeks, or to ask the EU for a longer delay. The House of Commons is expected to vote on this question on Tuesday, when the prime minister will ask MPs, for the third time, to approve her deal. 
MAR17	The school funding crisis will worsen if Philip Hammond keeps lowballing the education sector	Sunday’s televised clash between Andrew Marr and Philip Hammond highlighted the tension over the direction of public spending now that the fiscal deficit is broadly under control. The chancellor spoke about the funds the government was putting into education, while Marr challenged him about schools having to close early and, in one case, a headteacher cleaning toilets to save money. This echoes claims made after the Autumn Budget that the chancellor was being condescending towards schools when he said that the one-off £400m bonus he announced then would help them “buy the little extras they need”.
MAR17	Heroes like Abdul Aziz are beacons of light for all of us following the darkness of the Christchurch attacks	I want to express my respect and admiration to Abdul Aziz, originally from Afghanistan, who was in the congregation at the Linwood mosque in Christchurch with his four sons last Friday afternoon, and who, after hearing shots outside, grabbed a credit-card machine and ran outside to confront the gunman. I had wondered why the death toll at the Linwood mosque (seven people) was much lower than that at the Al Noor mosque. Aziz is the reason.
MAR17	After the New Zealand terror attack, the positive teachings of the Quran are a force for good in my life	In the aftermath of New Zealand’s deadliest ever terrorist atrocity, in which 49 people were killed and dozens more seriously injured, numerous unanswered questions have been brought to the surface.

Does the Quran teach me to take up arms and declare war or does it present a different solution entirely?
MAR18	John Bercow’s ruling has changed everything – Europe now decides the fate of Brexit	How much does the European Union actually care about keeping the UK inside the Union? I ask this because, after Speaker Bercow's historic ruling, Britain’s destiny now lies in the hands of 27 “foreign” governments, our partners in the EU. Assuming – as things stand it is reasonable to do so – that Mrs May fails again to win support in the Commons for her “deal”, then things move, once again, into Brussels’ court. Mr Bercow has, in effect, hit the reset button.
MAR18	New Zealand is bringing in gun control after one mass shooting. Why doesn't America value its citizens in the same way?	Twenty-four hours had not passed after a horrific terrorist attack by a white supremacist on innocent worshipping Muslims, and members of the New Zealand government announced that they were planning to ban semi-automatic assault rifles and introduce tighter gun control laws. While some might claim that this move will diminish New Zealanders' sense of freedom and safety — but the data suggests the exact opposite.  My story about guns begins from my childhood, when my dad bought us a pellet gun. It wasn’t a lethal firearm — but it was a tool that helped us develop hunting skills and understand firearm safety. And as we spent our summers hunting rabbits, birds, and engaging in target practice with old Coca Cola cans on the five-acre former farm that was our home, we never suffered an injury as a result of firearm negligence.
MAR18	How a lowly German football club is inspiring a movement that counters the ugly side of the sport	Racist organisations have long coveted the collective power of football fans. In Britain, football – The National Game – remains the most popular sport in the country. To many who follow it, such is the tribal pull of their fandom; the word “sport” doesn’t even come close to describing the importance of football in their lives. Whether it’s the National Fronts’ presence on the crumbling terraces of the seventies or eighties, or more recently, the recruitment drives outside British stadia by the English Defence League or the Football Lads Alliance, such organizations have long known that within football, there’ll always be a gene pool of passionate men ripe to radicalise.
MAR18	We know how higher education fails black students, so what’s stopping us from fixing it?	Almost every elder I know has uttered a version of the sentence: “Jobs like those are not for people like us,” as if we’d all been conditioned to think we were only meant to go down one rigid path while others excelled and prevailed in all sorts of avenues. It wasn’t until I was 15 that it finally clicked that, unfortunately, we have been taught to think like that, because that’s exactly how racial inequality works in society.
MAR18	Why football can open the door to overdue conversations about mental health	Mental health is an important topic in football, especially given the highly competitive nature of being a sports star in the public eye. I’m not sure how I’d feel if I had the weight of the nation’s happiness resting on whether I scored a penalty. But that collective happiness that penalty shots have the power to make or break can be used proactively.

MAR18	Jeremy Hunt has given us a scarier prospect than Brexit – he’s the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May	Several weeks before the official Grand National at Aintree, the event guaranteed to be styled as the Conservative version is under way at Westminster. The starter, Theresa May, hasn’t yet raised the flag (the white one of surrender). But with the PM reportedly on the brink of naming her departure date to help shove her Brexit deal over the line, more and more runners are milling about the parade ring.
MAR18	Kamala Harris and Beto O'Rourke should duck out now and make way for the real progressives in the Democratic race	Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke and Senator Kamala Harris need to step aside and let the tried and true liberals run for the Democratic nomination — otherwise it just might cost Dems the White House in 2020.  There has been way too much buzz already round Beto O’Rourke and Senator Kamala Harris, a buzz which makes them look like the shining liberal-but-not-too-liberal stars of the party in the race to beat Trump. So let’s examine whether they really deserve it.
MAR18	It is our shared responsibility to challenge hate. This is what we can do to stop it	As an immigrant to New Zealand, I am saddened and outraged by the events in Christchurch. The apparent innocence of New Zealand has been stripped away by acts of cowardice and evil. Read more: Christchurch mosque shootings must end New Zealand's innocence about right-wing terrorism  
MAR18	John Bercow might just have provided a simple route to getting a Final Say on Brexit	John Bercow’s explosive ruling that Theresa May cannot put her Brexit deal to parliament a third time came as a shock to ministers. But it should not have done. This scenario has been much discussed in recent days. Indeed, there was almost a vote on it last Thursday. The speaker chose for debate an amendment by Chris Bryant, a Labour MP who would like to succeed Bercow, saying that under parliamentary precedent, the same deal should not be the subject of another vote. 
MAR18	Bercow’s glorious revolution scuppers May – and edges us ever closer to a Final Say referendum	Whether he sought it or not, the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has secured his place in history. In asserting the powers of the House of Commons as against the authority of the Crown – in today’s terms the authority of the prime minister – he has recalled some of the great parliamentary struggles for supremacy from the past. He has also very likely changed the course of Brexit, and for the good. It is something of a glorious revolution. Speaker Bercow was right to rule as he has – that the government cannot keep bringing back the same “meaningful vote” proposition and receiving the same answer. There are two powerful reasons for this.
MAR19	Joe Biden is not the meme you love — this is the dark truth about his voting record	Having entered the United States Senate in 1973, Joe Biden has been a fixture of American public life for decades. Thanks to his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration, the longtime Senator’s stature has only grown throughout the past decade — making him one of the country’s best-known liberal politicians and a prospective leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.  Biden’s real, if superficial, appeal rests heavily on his image as an affable, blue-collar everyman at once populist and easygoing: an image arguably shaped more by social media and cable TV than by reality. Indeed, you might even say that there are two Joe Bidens: one a character, the other a real-life politician.  
MAR19	My cousin died in the New Zealand attack. Will Christchurch finally change the way we view global terrorism?	Yesterday I met my cousin – even though he was killed in cold blood, a few days ago, during the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand. While my cousin, Atta Elayyan, lived in Kuwait and later New Zealand, I was living in Jordan and North America. We had never crossed paths while the two of us lived. So I finally “met” him upon visiting his aunt’s house, where I learned much more about this ambitious 33-year-old whose life was cut so short.  
MAR19	The world’s most expensive cities list tells us what’s right with the global economy – and what isn’t	Why are cities so expensive? And given that they are, why do so many people flock to them? The top three most expensive cities in the world are Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong – all ranked equal first by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), part of The Economist magazine group.
MAR19	New Zealand is bringing in gun control after one mass shooting. Why doesn't America value its citizens in the same way?	Twenty-four hours had not passed after a horrific terrorist attack by a white supremacist on innocent worshipping Muslims, and members of the New Zealand government announced that they were planning to ban semi-automatic assault rifles and introduce tighter gun control laws.

MAR19	MPs warn that grime music is under threat from institutionalised racism – it’s mostly their fault	As times have changed, drill and rap music have taken over from grime as the leading subcultural fascination in the UK. Grime arose under a New Labour government intent on over-policing and gentrifying poor inner-London communities. Aggressive, cheeky, and competitive, the genre thrived off displays of confidence at sweaty raves, youth club practice sessions, and pirate radio broadcasts. Instead, drill music in particular comes after years of Conservative austerity. A sense of demonisation felt amongst the working class, predominantly black British young men who leverage the unapologetic genre as a medium of expression has persisted. Compared to grime, drill is the sound of an additional two decades of suppressed anger, normalised territorial violence, claustrophobic housing and exclusionary schooling. And its rapid growth has been enabled via the shareability and democratic hypervisibility of social media.
MAR19	Would you invest in Britain right now? How Brexit delays will make the UK a pariah for global investors	You’re sitting in a boardroom overseas, with money to deploy and jobs to create. The chair opens a discussion on where to invest it. I want to hear your ideas, she says. Once upon a time, were someone to have piped up with “what about Britain?” it might have enjoyed a relatively smooth passage onto the shortlist.
MAR19	Terrorists like the Christchurch gunman feed off everyday hate – it's up to us to fight it at its source	The recent attack in New Zealand reminds us that terror can strike anywhere. One of the critical objectives of terrorists is to inspire fear, copy-cat attacks and perhaps even to provoke retaliation so that their “inter-cultural war” may continue. In situations like these, it’s usually said we can “only hope” that security services successfully stop additional attacks. But we can do more than that, we can help by diminishing the killer’s notoriety.
MAR19	The desperate leaders of Isis remind us how retribution must always give way to the sane pursuit of justice	The terrorist responsible for the deaths of 50 people and for injuring 50 more in the attacks on mosques in New Zealand probably wouldn’t wish to be thought of in the same way as Osama bin Laden. And yet the parallels are apparent.  Both used the technology available to them in the most effective, high-profile manner they could. Both chose “soft”, under-defended targets. Both realised the power of political propaganda and how to tie a message to an act of mass murder. Both had an acute understanding of the modern media, and the culture of 24-hour digital news.
MAR20	The Democrats are about to hand a guaranteed 2020 election victory to Donald Trump on a plate	Democrats accuse President Trump of violating the norms of the American presidency and our political system, and in most cases, they’re correct.  Unfortunately, instead of making clear they will right where Trump went wrong, some members of the party apparatus and 2020 presidential candidates aren’t advocating correction. What they’re proposing seeks to over-correct, creating an environment in which Trump can win a second term by labeling Democrats the extremists. 
MAR20	People think Ivanka is complicit in Trump's presidency — but from what I've heard, she's the mastermind	Kushner, Inc. is generating buzz this week for its unflattering, out-of-touch portrayals of presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump. The book paints the former as more polished, but just as conniving and venal as her father. Indeed, author Vicky Ward portrays Ivanka as a Cersei Lannister-grade schemer.  Ivanka Trump seems to plays dumb a lot; we've all given her a pass and assumed she's merely "complicit" due to sexist stereotypes that say a pretty woman can't be capable of evil deeds. But what if Ivanka is the true mastermind of the entire Trump presidency? It looks to me like clues connecting her to virtually every aspect of the ongoing Trump-Russia scandal are littered everywhere — from her intimate friendship with rumored Putin mistress Wendi Deng to her personally curated involvement in the development of Trump Tower Moscow. 
MAR20	I've suffered from postpartum depression myself — but when I heard the FDA approved a new wonder drug, I didn't feel relieved	This week, the FDA announced approval for the first ever postpartum depression drug available in the US. Brexanolone, which is said to work within a day or two of an IV infusion, is being touted as a massive improvement over previous options and a huge relief for expectant mothers. While I read of this miracle cure, I thought about my own time as a young mother with a newborn. I was crestfallen with despair when I found I could barely cope. The stigma surrounding depression weighed heavily on me, and, as a single mother with few financial resources and no supportive family, some obstacles felt almost insurmountable to me.
MAR20	As Denmark kicks an MP out of parliament for bringing her baby, it's time to reassess its progressive reputation	It garnered international attention this week when the Danish politician Mette Abildgaard, carrying her five-month-old daughter, was asked to leave the voting chamber of the Danish parliament by the speaker, Pia Kjærsgaard. The story went viral because it clashes with Denmark’s reputation as a socially liberal and progressive country, but it is just the latest of a number of news stories that have chipped away at that reputation.
MAR20	Theresa May’s Brexit letter to Donald Tusk: what she said – and what she really meant	What Theresa May said: The UK government’s policy remains to leave the European Union in an orderly manner on the basis of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration agreed in November, complemented by the joint instrument and supplement to the political declaration president Juncker and I agreed on 11 March.  And what she really meant: Very little of the government’s policy remains. There is almost nothing of it, or of my already diminished authority, left. 
MAR20	People with personal mental health experiences are more qualified to work with patients, not less	It bewilders me that, in 2019, people are still being discriminated against in the workplace because of their mental health problems. I’ve interviewed many people who have, sadly, had to endure such challenging experiences. But shouldn’t we flip it on its head? What if we thought of lived experience as a good thing?
MAR20	Elizabeth Warren thinks getting rid of the electoral college would be an easy win for the Democrats. I wouldn't be so sure	Senator Elizabeth Warren announced her desire to abolish the electoral college on Monday night. “Every vote matters,” she said to a crowd at Jackson State University, “and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the electoral college.” Her call was endorsed the following day by Beto O’Rourke.  The Electoral College has been on thin ice for decades, with a majority of Americans favoring a constitutional amendment to install popular voting. That is, until the 2016 election, when, according to Gallup, Republican enthusiasm for the Electoral College rose dramatically.
MAR20	No wonder polling shows a second referendum would yield a Remain vote. We are in a mess	There’s no other way to say it: Brexit is a mess right now. So it’s not a great shock that the public would prefer to remain in the EU rather than accept Theresa May’s deal or a no-deal Brexit, according to a recent poll. This pro-EU stance is likely to be bolstered on Saturday with a mass demonstration in favour of a people’s vote. The upcoming march will be a long cry from the soggy, bedraggled mess that was the Brexit Betrayal march. Not least because those who called for this one might even bother to take part.
MAR20	Asking if we should 'sterilise' trans people shows how much discrimination we still face	“Should transgender people be sterilised before they are recognised?” asks The Economist.  What’s the harm in asking that, you might wonder? After all, it is “just a debate”. The issue of sterilisation of trans people has been around for some while. Not just in Japan (an excuse for this latest social media misstep), but much closer to home: rewind a decade and you will find this policy being applied in many otherwise liberal European democracies.
MAR20	We're marching on Saturday because Brexit will hit young people the hardest	We, the undersigned, are the elected representatives of learners from across the United Kingdom. We speak on behalf of students from higher education, further education and apprenticeship providers. Through our collective roles, we represent 830,000 learners across the UK.
MAR21	As the Article 50 petition hits 3 million signatures, could it really unseat the PM and save Britain from Brexit?	As (yet another) metaphor for the crash that is Brexit, the collapse of the government petitions website under the weight of signatures calling for Article 50 to be revoked cannot be bettered. Not only is the poor old country breaking under the strain of Brexit, but the very means by which we might look at some more radical solutions is itself out of service. 
MAR21	2020 Election: Stacey Abrams would be a great choice for Joe Biden's VP — but a better one for president	The apparent scoop du jour is that ex-VP Joe Biden is set to announce his bid with his running mate already picked out: former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Suggestions for his VP thus far have been a who’s-who of the current field of competition for the nomination, including Harris and O’Rourke. Abrams possibly becoming The Chosen One is somewhat surprising, because her star has only so recently begun its ascendency — but not too surprising, because of her fierce intellect, warm demeanor and popularity. Stacey Abrams exudes good sense and kindness, delivered with impeccable poise: that’s the impression most voters have of her.  Joe Biden indisputably has the longest resume and most experience out there. He’d been a senator for four decades when he became Vice President under Barack Obama, whose administration’s remarkable successes despite historic adversity and GOP obstruction have come much more sharply into focus with the relief of hindsight.
MAR21	I was caged, beaten and warehoused by Republicans at a 'concentration camp for throwaway teens' in the 1980s	America is shocked by the Trump administration’s putting kids in cages, but such tactics —designed to create terror and modify behaviour — are nothing new. Republicans have been using it for decades. I know: I was a kid caged by Republicans in the 1980s.  I don’t have to say I was “caged.” I could say I was “impounded” or “imprisoned.” To be new-razor precise, I’d choose the word “warehoused.” Because that’s where they stored us, the tens of thousands of teens whose parents didn’t want to deal with them anymore: in warehouses across the United States. 
MAR21	In Kazakhstan, the last Soviet era president has suddenly resigned – and this is what it means for my people	Kazakhstan, a post-Soviet oil-rich Central Asian country of 18 million people and the 9th largest territory in the world has just undergone a historical moment of epic proportions. The first and only president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has voluntarily resigned after nearly three decades in power. This news came as a shock to the world and to the people of Kazakhstan. For us, the younger generation under 30 – and we are nearly half of the country’s population – he was the only president we ever knew. The news has provoked a mixture of shock, excitement, fear and hope.
MAR21	Tech giants must now use their power to fight racist hate online	Sajid Javid, the home secretary, reflected the common view in the wake of the killings in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he told the big tech companies: “Take some ownership.

MAR21	Here’s how Article 50 could actually be revoked, even if the PM says she won’t do it	Democracy! Can’t live with it! Can’t live without it!  How grim to be an MP in this parliament. Resolved to do your best for the nation, as well as your constituents, according to your beliefs, yet you’re faced with Brexit and the intervention of the inconclusive referendum in the UK’s democratic processes. 
MAR21	I haven’t marched in almost 50 years – but for my grandchildren's future, I’ll fight for a Final Say on Brexit	It's been about 45 years since I last marched in protest. From 1969 to 1975, as a schoolgirl and then a student, I was at it all the time. Now, as a grandmother, I'm doing it again. But this Saturday, I'm getting up at the oldie-unfriendly time of 4am, to catch a coach from Newcastle to London (a coach! These days I travel by train first class with my senior rail card). I've been spurred to do more than just write to my MP, shout at the telly and listen to the Remainiacs podcast.
MAR21	Instagram's disturbing 'thinspiration' pictures fueled my anorexia – but there’s no point trying to regulate it	This week, a BBC investigation found that content encouraging eating disorders on Instagram is rife. This is no surprise. For as long as the internet has existed, so too have pro-eating disorder communities. In 2001, Yahoo removed over 100 so-called “pro-anorexia” sites from their servers. Over a decade later, the same communities are popping up again. I have struggled with anorexia on and off for over 10 years, and I am all too familiar with the dangers that social media can pose to those in the grasp of illness. During my first year at university, I fell deep into the Instagram hole of eating disorder content.
MAR21	He'll meet with Hamas and Sinn Fein – but a coffee with Chuka Umunna is a step too far for Jeremy Corbyn	Like Brutus in Julius Caesar, to his supporters, Corbyn is an honourable man. And much like Brutus, he has often found himself in murderous company – whether he’s simply "attending without participating" in a controversial debate, or actively engaging with those whose position on the political spectrum could perhaps be described as more extreme than a Brian Blessed cameo in a Tarantino movie. Perhaps the Labour leader's views on mingling with terrorists and their supporters have their merits in these insane times. In the 1980s, his meetings with Sinn Fein at a time when the Provisional IRA was still scattering bombs may have indirectly aided the Northern Ireland peace process. And though Corbyn speedily rescinded his fond description of Hamas as his "friends", many would agree that Palestine deserves support. Corbyn was always open to keeping a "back channel" to the Taliban ajar, too, and still believes there "has to be some route through somewhere" to what remains of Isis.
MAR22	Theresa May’s Brexit has been a farce – I will join the Put It To The People march to signal Scotland’s anger	Theresa May’s statement in Downing Street on Wednesday evening was shocking. Shocking in its level of denial, in its lack of humility and in its complete and utter lack of self-awareness. And shocking too in its complete refusal to take any personal responsibility for the fiasco which Brexit has become. The prime minister should have at least acknowledged that she bears a huge share of the blame for the utter shambles which is now unfolding and which has, perhaps permanently, shredded Britain’s reputation for sensible, level-headed diplomacy and statecraft.

MAR22	We need to talk about why New Zealand shooting suspect Brenton Tarrant praised China in his manifesto	The now-detained 28-year-old suspect of the New Zealand mosque shooting, Brenton Tarrant from Australia, is accused of killing 50 people last week in the city of Christchurch. He allegedly filmed himself doing so, and right before that, widely distributed a rambling manifesto. The suspect said he identifies most closely with what he sees as the Chinese government’s values, and that the Asian country’s strength comes from its being largely ethnically homogeneous. Specifically, the manifesto praises China’s “political and social values” and its being a “non-diversified country.” It should serve as an alarm for the way the Asian country is accused of treating its Uighur Muslim minority — because when the source of your praise is an alleged mass murderer, it’s clear to see that something has gone disturbingly wrong.
MAR22	I was diagnosed with cervical cancer at 24, now I use stand up comedy to raise awareness	I've always been funny, I have to say. I have a bit of a background in drama at uni, and I loved stand up, but I thought I could never do it. There was absolutely no way. I'm sure I would've been fine if I'd just gone for it, but at that time, I didn't think I had the right angle, I didn't know what to say. But when I was diagnosed with cervical cancer, all of that changed. I found out at the end of 2014. I was going into my third year of university at Birkbeck, doing evening classes in drama. A couple of months before that, I'd been spotting a little bit in between periods, but no more than a bloody discharge. So I didn't panic, I wasn't in pain or anything. I thought, it's because I've gone on holiday, or it's my pill.
MAR22	I was groomed as a child – ‘jokes’ about Adam Johnson show that people don’t understand the lasting impact of abuse	The footballer Adam Johnson, who was convicted in 2016 of sexual activity with a child and grooming, is out of prison. Of course, as we’ve come to expect, Twitter is awash with purest “BANTAAAAAAAA”: “Adam Johnson’s having a party, bring your homework, bring your Smarties”, writes one cheeky funster. Others have playfully pointed out that, since his victim is now 18, he can legally “have another crack”. Ha! Massive “LOLs” all round about the abuse of an underage girl. Whether or not he ever plays professional football again really isn’t of any interest to me. He will never escape what he did – the taunts, disgust and mistrust will never go away. What I’m more concerned about is the sympathy that’s being offered from some quarters, not on the grounds that “he’s served his time”, but that they imagine the girl somehow invited his behaviour and encouraged it, and the supposed mitigation that she had the physical appearance of a grown woman.
MAR22	Mea Culpa: a grammar glitch in George Michael’s art collection	All praise to whoever wrote the headline on our report of an auction: “I knew you were bidding: George Michael’s art collection fetches £11.3m”. Marvellous.  However, Paul Eustice wrote to point out a common crime against The Independent’s style in the story itself. We wrote: “The collection, comprised of more than 150 lots ...”.  As he said, comprised means consisted of, so the convention is that it is not followed by “of”. We should have said, “The collection comprised more than 150 lots …” or, “The collection, consisting of more than 150 lots …” 
MAR22	Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes succeeded because of toxic millennial 'fake it til you make it' culture	HBO’s documentary The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley is an expose about Theranos, the blood-testing company founded by millennial media darling Elizabeth Holmes at age 19. However, underneath that is a story of what happens when personal branding and the ethos of “fake it till you make it” go too far.  To recap: Holmes claimed she had invented a way to revolutionise phlebotomy and make testing for diseases regularly possible. At the center of her vision was a machine called The Edison that, according to her, would eventually be available for purchase by individual consumers who could take control of their health by conducting their own blood tests. 
MAR22	Whether Leave or Remain, it is the people who should now decide the future of our country	Even if little else good emerges from the Brexit phenomenon, and historians look back upon it as a strange aberration, it has at least confounded some unhelpful pieces of conventional wisdom. On Saturday, for example, many hundreds of thousands are expected to join The Independent and others on the Put It To The People march in London – proof, were it needed, that people are hugely engaged with this vital issue. Some 3 million – and counting – have signed the official petition seeking a cancellation of Brexit, and for the Article 50 process to be ended. More than a million have given their support to a petition calling for a second referendum. While there may be some overlap between the two groups, together that constitutes a significant proportion of the adult population.
MAR22	Theresa May’s only aim is to keep the Conservative Party together at all costs	Those who say Theresa May doesn’t have a plan for Brexit are completely wrong. May has had a plan from the outset and she has rigorously followed it, come what may.  
MAR22	Brexit was built on false promises – let’s walk away from this impending disaster	Stronger together: this is a phrase that I really do believe in.  When we voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, I was in a state of shock and disbelief. My heart was broken. “How could we do that?” I asked myself. But back then, whatever my opinion, it was “the will of the people”. 52 per cent of the population had voted differently to me and, despite my views, I had to respect that. We all did – or so we thought.
MAR23	Saturday's Put It To The People march is further proof that the tide has changed and Brexit is not what people want	Today’s truly epic march is testimony to the groundswell of public opinion turning against Brexit. A groundswell so great that it can no longer be ignored in a fully functioning democracy. Many media outlets have until now seldom been willing to allow those marching today a voice, but have instead been happy to air meaningless soundbites and bullying language of the kind that has for too long suffocated constructive, pragmatic debate or discussion.  
MAR23	Don’t believe the hype, Isis has not yet been defeated – here’s why	After all the headlines about the supposed defeat of Isis, anyone who doesn’t believe a word of it may seem a bit of a spoilsport. But whenever I read that victory has been declared – whether it be of the Bush “mission accomplished” variety or the “last Isis stronghold about to fall” fantasy – I draw in my breath. Because you can make a safe bet that it’s not true. Not just because the fighting around Baghouz is, in fact, still continuing outside the wrecked town. But because there are plenty of Isis fighters still under arms and ready to fight in the Syrian province of Idlib, along with their Hayat Tahrir al Sham, al-Nusra and al-Qaeda comrades – almost surrounded by Syrian government troops but with a narrow corridor in which they could escape to Turkey; always supposing that Sultan Erdogan will let them. There are Russian troop outposts inside these Islamist front lines, along with Turkish military forces but the tentative ceasefire which held for five months has become a lot more tenuous in the past few weeks.
MAR23	Tom Watson defied Corbyn and spoke for millions at the Put It To The People march	Tom Watson is the alternative leader of the opposition as well as the deputy leader of the Labour Party. Because he has his own mandate from party members, he can speak for the other part of a divided party.  While Jeremy Corbyn had other priorities, Mr Watson attended and spoke at the Put It To The People march in London today. “Here are the people, Theresa May: you don’t speak for us,” he said. 
MAR23	We don’t need a ‘soft Brexit’ – it’s simply an easy way out	We don’t need a soft Brexit any more than we need Theresa May’s bargain basement bundle or to leave the EU at all. There are absolutely no grounds for or gains in any kind of Brexit. A softer Brexit is simply an “easy way out” aimed at appeasing the right-wing faction, and you’d have to be a bit “soft” in the head to want to do it! What’s the point of being in the club without a voice? There are more than enough grounds to revoke Article 50 anyway. Our sensible MPs need to stand up, get together and do just that.
MAR23	The Top 10: Anonymous Books	Peter Warner started this list with Gulliver’s Travels – although I chose Robinson Crusoe instead because it was the first of that kind – and Primary Colors. I excluded the Torah and the Bible, because I didn’t want to get into theological disputes, but here are the rest, in chronological order.  1. The Iliad and The Odyssey, 8th century BC. “The Homeric question must be one of the longest literary controversies: ‘Homer’ is similar to Greek for hostage,” said Graham Kirby, prompting various theories about whether they have a single author.

MAR23	I marched for a second referendum on Brexit so I could finally be down with the kids	I am not a politician. I am, however, a dad, who lives in the world. A world in which, over the last few years, sanity seems to have been replaced by a kind of aimless mania. I realise that as a nearly 47-year-old man, I am entering into a kind of confused middle-age where it is completely natural to feel a befuddlement at all things new, but this feels different. 
MAR23	Europe can’t rely on the US to regulate tech giants like Google and Facebook	The push to control the US high-tech giants is gathering pace, with the UK and Europe so far making the running. Notable elements in this drive have included last week a fine of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) on Google by the European Commission for blocking advertising rivals, last month the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s report on fake news, and the report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, chaired by former chief economist to President Obama, Professor Jason Furman, which came out 10 days ago. There will be much more to come from this side of the Atlantic, and there are two main reasons why Europe should be taking the lead. The first is that these companies are all American, so any attack on them is not attacking domestic business. The second is that Europeans have different ideas about privacy from Americans – and indeed from each other.
MAR23	We need to embrace people who voted to leave if we really want to stop Brexit	How many people will have signed the petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked by the end of today’s Put It To The People march kicks off? Five million? The sheer number to date, and the speed at which they’ve been coming, has already crashed the government’s petitions website several times. Kudos to those working on it, by the way. They’ve been sweating blood. 
MAR24	Yesterday’s march proved it: MPs can no longer ignore young people’s views on Brexit	Yesterday, I was one in a million. We marched on the streets to demand our politicians put it to the people and end the Brexit crisis. The last week in Westminster was almost unbearable. The bunker mentality of politicians worsened and the gridlock persisted. Our prime minister’s dangerous attempt to pit MPs against the people in her national address failed dramatically. All the while our country, crippled by uncertainty, watched a government refuse to face up to reality with horror.
MAR24	Universities are still leaving BAME students behind – and the problem goes beyond Oxbridge	Do British universities have a problem with attracting, admitting and retaining Black, Minority Ethnic (BAME) students? Official figures show that while record numbers of BAME students are attending university, up from 13 per cent to 20 per cent between 2002-3 and 2016-17, there is also a complex leaky ethnic pipeline that is holding back progress. New measures launched by the government to tackle ethnic disparities in higher education as part of a broader effort to “explain or change” inequalities will mean that institutions have to publish statistics on admissions and attainment, broken down by ethnicity, gender and socio-economic background.
MAR24	How women from Islamic republics fight gender inequality all over the world	The world is constantly reassessing women’s place in society: their reproductive rights, workplace equality, safety on the streets, education. We talk about liberation, from the patriarchy, from stigma and from religion; some people believe that the world would be a better place without Islam in particular. We in the west are often on the receiving end of reports that the lives of women in Islamic republics are endangered, restricted and alien to what we know. But having spoken to women on the other side of the veil, I discovered why freedom of religion can often be more empowering than freedom from it.
MAR24	Tom Watson defied Corbyn and spoke for millions at the Put It To The People march	Tom Watson is the alternative leader of the opposition as well as the deputy leader of the Labour Party.

MAR24	Whichever way you spin it, the Mueller report is a massive win for Trump — and a huge boost to his chances of re-election	So we now know what Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign slogan will be: “No collusion, No obstruction.” We know, too, that Robert Mueller’s report will likely act as a huge boost to the president’s chance of being re-elected 18 months from now. Mueller did not say definitively that Trump did not collude with Russia to influence the 2016 election, or that he did not try to interfere with investigations into such accusations. He said, rather, that he found no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. He also said while he set out the case for and against the accusation of obstruction of justice in regards to several incidents, he “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement”. It was attorney general Bill Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, who decided the president’s actions did not constitute a crime.
MAR24	Philip Hammond has seen the light on a second referendum – now parliament must back a Final Say on Brexit	It appears that the knives are out for the prime minister. After yesterday’s Put It To The People march drew a million people to London calling for a second referendum, it should perhaps be no surprise that the momentum for change is growing. Indeed, with a petition demanding that Article 50 be revoked having now received over five million signatures, it would remiss of senior politicians to bury their heads in the sand.
MAR24	Sorry Theresa, but democracy is a rolling process. We may have wanted Brexit before, but we don’t now	When a million people march against Brexit, compared with 150 on Farage’s feeble counter-march, the government should wake up to the will of the people.   When the biggest ever parliamentary petition to revoke Article 50 already has just shy of five million signatures, more than 10 times the number who signed a petition to crash out without a deal, the government should wake up to the will of the people. Democracy is a rolling process of collective will. It’s always moving.
MAR25	Parliament takes control and clears the path for a softer Brexit – but May's zombie deal could still rise again	It was the vote that finally told us who is really in charge of Brexit – and on Monday night parliament took back control from the prime minister. The majority of 27 in favour of Oliver Letwin’s amendment to stage a series of indicative votes was larger than expected – and shows the strength of feeling among MPs. They have run out of patience with Theresa May’s months-long strategy of intransigence and running down the clock. On the face of it, granting MPs an opportunity to come up with a Brexit plan B from a menu of options points to a softer Brexit – blocking a no deal and shifting away from May’s twice-defeated withdrawal agreement. 
MAR25	If you’re thinking of applying for Love Island, the reality TV suicide rate should make you think again	In the past year, three people connected with the reality TV show Love Island have taken their own lives. Two, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, were contestants, the third was Sophie’s boyfriend Aaron Armstrong who killed himself just weeks after Sophie’s body was found in her home last June. If, as has been suggested, both Sophie and Mike’s mental health were badly affected by appearing on the programme, then I’m not sure I’ll be able to watch it again. How can I tune in without worrying who, amongst this year’s cast, might be too vulnerable for life through a camera lens?
MAR25	As two young Labour and Conservative voters, this we can agree on: Our party leaders are a joke	We expect entrenched and petulant stubbornness from toddlers, not leaders. But this country is facing the starkest example of intransigent “leadership” it has ever seen, at a time when dialogue is most needed. We are two young voters, one Conservative, and one Labour. Though we have many differences of opinion, on this we agree.
MAR25	Universities are still leaving BAME students behind – and the problem goes beyond Oxbridge	Do British universities have a problem with attracting, admitting and retaining Black, Minority Ethnic (BAME) students?

MAR25	Could robot recruiters finally end workplace discrimination for good?	Like many people, I recognise the benefits that automation has brought to certain areas of society but I still recoil at the idea of robots replacing key workers. I don’t trust robo-doctors and police bots make me uneasy. I also worry about the threat that assistance robots can pose to human life when they malfunction. But would I be comfortable with a robot interviewing me for a job? Absolutely. In fact, I’d like to see robots interviewing candidates in every office and recruitment agency in Britain. Why? Because robots that have been designed specifically for recruitment purposes are generally much better than humans at making unbiased decisions about a candidate. The results of an experiment in Sweden, where robot recruiters have been used to conduct interviews, proves this to be true.
MAR25	Yes, I'm a bride-to-be who had a stag do – so what?	Amid all the debates, votes, and general bad-tempered chuntering about Brexit of the last few months, I’ve been planning my wedding. It has been a useful exercise in reminding me that normal life continues apace away from the Houses of Parliament; though often, the politics of Westminster pales in comparison to the stresses of putting together a functional table plan that won’t lead to bust-ups, all whilst not eating enough so you fit into a wedding dress (I’ve been low-level ravenous for approximately nine months now). When I got engaged last year, I immediately set about contacting my nearest and dearest to inform them of the happy news...family and friends...male and female. When we finally celebrated our betrothal with engagement drinks, I invited my friends, male and female. When we drafted the invitation list for the wedding itself, again, I included both male and female friends. All standard procedure.

MAR25	The Conservative Party is assuring its own destruction over Brexit	Up the drive to Chequers they came, one by glorious one, the worst political project this country has ever known. There was Dominic Raab, who was Brexit secretary barely long enough to discover Britain is an island. 
MAR25	I’ve been watching Brexit from Australia, and I have no idea how anyone is keeping up	As a British citizen living abroad in Australia, I can’t make sense of this Brexit stuff. It seems that both a no-deal Brexit and an Article 50 revocation are off the table while parliament works on some middle road like a “Norway model”.
MAR25	Robert Mueller has given Trump a rare good day, and a tool to rally his supporters as 2020 looms	The Trump presidency has known some good days, more bad days, and plenty of angry days. Many of the bad days came as a result, directly or indirectly, of the allegations about collusion with the Russian authorities during the 2016 presidential election.  No other issue, not even the wall or the government shutdown, has caused the ever-changing cast of the Trump administration more trouble than the notion that the 2016 election was, in effect, stolen with the assistance of a foreign power – tantamount to treason.
MAR26	As a former adviser to Hillary Clinton, I worried Democrats would walk right into this Mueller mess — and they did	The writing was on the wall early in the Mueller investigation: the special counsel was targeting figures in Donald Trump’s orbit like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, but not necessarily Trump and his immediate family.   As far back as 2017, I shared my concerns publicly, arguing that too much hope was being placed in the Mueller probe. In November 2017, I tweeted, “I've been saying it for months and it's just my personal take, but from all outward signs, it appears the people going down over #TrumpRussia are Manafort, Flynn, Page, etc. Not Trump himself.”
MAR26	A government of national unity might be the only way out of this Brexit crisis – but imagine that with today’s lot	Don’t feel ashamed if this comes as news to you, but this country boasts an entity called “the government”. I didn’t realise myself until this morning. I had been vaguely aware of a bunch of people in the SW1 postcode who squabble under the alleged authority of a crazy person who spouts gibberish neither she nor anyone else can possibly believe. But then, a few hours ago, I read this quote: “The government warned that the Monday night vote [for tomorrow’s indicative votes; the ones “the government” intends to ignore] had set a ‘dangerous, unpredictable precedent’.”
MAR26	Are we headed for a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis after all?	Quite suddenly the R-word, recession, has reared up on the world counts. Last week, a sudden wave of fear ripped through the financial markets, with the bond markets giving a signal that we should expect an economic downturn in the coming months. There are several elements here. US bond prices rose, or looked round the other way, long-term US interest rates fell, so that the interest rate on 10-year bonds fell below that of three-month Treasury bills.
MAR26	Namibia's Environment Minister rejects criticism over trophy hunting	Namibia's current and Kenya's former ministers for environment engaged in a lively discussion about the polarising issue of trophy hunting at a debate held in at The Arts Club in London on Monday 25 March.  Professor Judi Wakhungu, Kenya’s former Cabinet Secretary of Environment, Water, and Natural Resources, said that her country’s position on hunting is “diametrically opposed” to that of her co-panelist Pohamba Shifeta, Minister of Environment and Tourism in Namibia since 2015.
MAR26	Nasa’s incompetence has scuppered the first all-female spacewalk – no surprise given its sexist history	Today Nasa postponed its first all-female spacewalk because they didn’t have the right spacesuits. While the headlines makes this situation sound almost laughable, what it highlights is a long-running problem regarding getting women into space. This Friday, on 29 March, two astronauts were set to make history by becoming the first all-women crew to walk in space. Instead of Anne McClain and Christina Koch however, the spacewalk will be completed by Koch and another colleague, Nick Hague, instead. The landmark occasion has been scuppered.

MAR26	Resistance Twitter's response to the Mueller report tells you everything you need to know	Mueller, She Wrote, a podcast starring three women who've spent the better part of the Trump administration documenting the twists and turns of the Russia probe, announced that they've gained 300 new backers to their Patreon since the infamous William Barr synopsis dropped on Sunday.  "We have decided to begin recording DAILY ad-free news updates TONIGHT," read the tweet. "Join today!"
MAR26	Kubrat Pulev kissed Jenny SuShe without her consent – it’s time men stopped humiliating women in the workplace	Have you ever had a sweaty, bleeding man who punches people for a living, high on testosterone and toxic masculinity, unexpectedly grab you and force a kiss on you while you were just trying to do your job? If not, you're luckier than reporter Jenny SuShe, who was trying to interview Bulgarian boxer Kubrat Pulev after a match and was subjected to what looked to me (and a lot of other people) like sexual assault. The video of the incident makes for uncomfortable viewing. Pulev towers over SuShe, who seems to be trying to lean away from him. She asks a few questions and after answering the final one he grabs her by the head, forces his mouth against hers and walks away, leaving her alone on camera to mask her reaction and laugh nervously. "OK, thank you!" she concludes, clearly flustered.
MAR26	No matter what the outcome of the indicative votes on Brexit, we’ll still need a second referendum	One of the original sins of Brexit is the way in which the government, and especially the prime minister, have repeatedly ignored the will and wishes of parliament. Theresa May loftily informed our elected representatives she would not be giving a “running commentary”. She initially refused a vote on Article 50. She never sought approval for her various red lines. We see now that this attitude was arrogant and counterproductive. Even when she still enjoyed the modest overall parliamentary majority she inherited from David Cameron, that was a dangerous game. Since she became the head of a minority government after the 2017 general election, this wilful refusal to listen to MPs doubts has been the undoing of the prime minister and her deal. If either survives the next few weeks it will be a surprise.
MAR26	I'm so utterly fatigued by Brexit that I will never vote in an election again	I have voted in every parliamentary election since I have been able – for the last 45 years. I will never vote under any circumstances in any future election. It matters not which party or candidates I have voted for, it matters not how I voted in the Brexit referendum, I have completely and utterly lost all faith in the UK parliament.
MAR27	Theresa May has finally announced she will step down as PM – but her legacy will continue to haunt us all	When I look at Theresa May I feel a terrible sense of a wasted premiership. Brexit was, of course, always going to dominate it, and she knew it – and in the end it has proved her downfall, although still now we don’t know the precise timings, despite her statement to the 1922 Committee today.
MAR27	I'm a born and bred New Yorker — but I've realised this year that I have to leave	I’m a fourth generation born-and-raised New Yorker but I can no longer afford to stay here comfortably. I’ve lived in Long Island, less than an hour outside of Manhattan, my entire 32 years. When my working-class parents ascended to middle-class status, they moved us out to the suburbs, escaping the crime-ridden, decaying New York City of the 1980s. At the time, home ownership was not out of reach for couples with median-income jobs.  Although not rich in material possessions, I was grateful for my upbringing and wasn’t looking to move far away. I attended a local college and worked in my community after graduation and throughout my 20s, diligently saving money with the intent of climbing the same middle-class mountain as my parents; maybe even scaling a little higher. 
MAR27	‘Cultural Marxism’ is a far-right conspiracy in murky internet forums – so why is a Tory MP now using it?	Type “cultural Marxism” into YouTube and it won’t be long until you come to a certain genre of video. “CULTURAL MARXISM: The corruption of America” is a low-production movie which asserts that “cultural Marxists seek to destroy American free-enterprise capitalism by undermining its economic engine, the Middle Class and this will lead – they hope – to the destruction of the basic building block of society: the Family Unit”.   A couple of videos down is Pat Condell, a well known reactionary YouTuber suggesting that “cultural Marxists” – a term that he doesn’t define – are “silencing” people, and unfairly using terms like “bigot” and “racist”. Dig a little further though, and you’ll find that, online at least, the deployment of “cultural Marxism” isn’t just a right-wing talking point, but also one that is used deliberately by the reactionary right.
MAR27	While the Tories chose austerity, Portugal decided to invest – and its economy is now booming	It is intriguing to note that Portugal’s budget deficit fell to 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2018, the lowest level since the country returned to democracy 45 years ago. This clearly demonstrates that there is an alternative to austerity as the deficit has fallen from 11.2 per cent of GDP in 2011 when Portugal negotiated a €78bn bailout with the EU and the International Monetary Fund.
MAR27	Has Penny Mordaunt got away with the worst Mumsnet performance ever?	Courting the nation's mothers by answering questions on a Mumsnet webchat is a well-established rite of passage for ambitious politicians. But Penny Mordaunt’s excruciating session appears to be one she hopes no one noticed.  She left the vast majority of Mumsnet users’ questions unanswered, and evaded the point of others. “Disappointed but not surprised” wrote one poster. “Completely disingenuous”, “This is unforgiveable”, wrote others. Mordaunt should have known that Mumsnet would be a demanding audience.  She has lead the Government Equalities Office in pushing to liberalise the Gender Recognition Act so that anyone can change their legal sex without medical diagnosis or treatment. Already her office issues guidance telling businesses and public sector agencies that they should allow people to access “single sex” facilities such as communal changing rooms and dormitories based on their self-identified sense of gender, not their physical sex. And in its own internal equal opportunities monitoring it has stopped asking about sex altogether.
MAR27	Tom Watson defied Corbyn and spoke for millions at the Put It To The People march	Tom Watson is the alternative leader of the opposition as well as the deputy leader of the Labour Party. Because he has his own mandate from party members, he can speak for the other part of a divided party.  While Jeremy Corbyn had other priorities, Mr Watson attended and spoke at the Put It To The People march in London today. “Here are the people, Theresa May: you don’t speak for us,” he said. 
MAR27	Will Jordan Peele’s ‘Us’ finally end the pigeonholing of black people in film?	Since the release of the trailer for Us, the latest box-office horror smash from Jordan Peele, the writer-director-producer has been very clear about the intention behind his casting decisions. The main characters in the film – a young successful family, the Wilsons, later hounded by their own doppelgangers while on an otherwise idyllic beach-house holiday – are black.
MAR27	I was nearly deported under the Home Office’s 'deport first, ask questions later' approach. This is why it’s so terrifying	I was taken to detention without warning last year and without a chance to collect my belongings for an unknown length of time. It was hard to imagine what would come next. Little did I know, I would be part of a growing number of people facing deportation. A year ago, I was loaded into a van surrounded by immigration removal officers and taken to Heathrow Airport. I was scared and didn’t know what was going on. What I did know is that I would not get the chance to see my friends again or have any of my belongings with me.  
MAR27	Parliament has voted against all Brexit options – which could help Theresa May get her deal through	The House of Commons has voted against all eight Brexit options in its X Factor contest. It is a boost to the prime minister’s hopes of getting her deal through – on the same day that Boris Johnson and several other Tory rebels backed it, but the DUP said “no”.  Unless she can persuade the DUP to vote for her deal, her chances of taking the UK out of the EU and thus ending her premiership, as she confirmed today, seem remote. But if the DUP is really playing tough before switching at the last moment, then she now has a slightly better chance of securing a majority in parliament for her deal than she had before. 
MAR27	Whoever succeeds Theresa May will have to realise a second referendum is the only way to resolve Brexit	No greater love can a politician have for their cause than to lay down their career for its life. And so it is with Theresa May, Brexit and her martyrdom. Her near-religious devotion to the deal she spent the past two years negotiating, and then trying to renegotiate, is such that she has kept faith in it despite it suffering two historic, crushing defeats in the House of Commons.
MAR28	Trump’s critics wanted Mueller to find Russian collusion – but his report leaves them soul-searching	Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to investigate collusion between Donald Trump’s election campaign and Russia, was presented by US Democrats and much of the US media as a paragon of the honourable and careful lawyer. If anyone could get to the bottom of the supposedly murky relationship between Trump and Russia, he was your man.  
MAR28	The momentum has finally switched to Remain – Theresa May has engineered a political sea change	As Brexit rumbles on, we should be grateful we’re not in the 16th century. Imagine living back then, when leaders of parliament had to beg to a group of entitled Etonian idiots led by a deranged character in a monocle, to be allowed to carry on for a while. But at least feudal rulers were efficient. The rule in the current government is everyone has to resolutely support the opposite of what they resolutely supported yesterday morning.  
MAR28	American soldiers aren't dying for our freedom in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They're dying for nothing	President Trump has promised repeatedly to end “endless wars,” during both his campaign and his tenure so far in office. Despite this rhetoric, endless — and, frankly, pointless —wars are, sadly, still the American norm. Two more Americans were just killed in Afghanistan — a war that the Trump administration realises needs to end, but seems in no hurry to actually do so. In December 2018, Trump announced that all US troops would be withdrawn from Syria, only to later rescind that declaration in favour of a small force of 400 to 1,000 troops to stay behind indefinitely, complementing the more than 5,000 troops in Iraq, who are there to satiate the administration’s obsession with Iran.
MAR28	Customer loyalty saved Waterstones, now we need to show up for its employees too	At the end of last year, it became clearer than ever that the British high street is in trouble. Retail faced its worst Christmas since the financial crash, and a further 10,000 shops are predicted to close this year. Few, however, have spoken up for the workers in the sector.  That changed a couple of days ago, when 1,300 authors backed a petition for Waterstones’ booksellers to be paid the living wage.
MAR28	If you think affluent black people or mixed race people shouldn't qualify for reparations, I have something to tell you	 We all agree that apologising can be hard. But real apologies are necessary to building strong communities and futures. A few nations on this side of the Atlantic are wrestling with this on a national scale.
MAR28	Obamacare was OK, but Trumpcare will stop abortions and give you free cages for your kids — who could argue with that?	The Trump administration wants to overturn Obamacare in a move that would strip healthcare away from 20 million Americans. The GOP calls this “governing”; others have some less polite words. It seems that the president thinks a majority of Americans support him on this issue because a recent Fox News poll on healthcare gave him an approval rating of 37 per cent. “Many people have said they totally support me on healthcare and they’ve said so very strongly,” he has said.  I presume Donald Trump is unmoved by Democrats’ claims that 62 per cent of all bankruptcies in the US are caused by medical debt because to him, bankruptcies are what happen when you open your second casino next to your first. Why be concerned about the fact that around 100 million Americans will be affected by your proposed changes to healthcare law when 100 million is just a number you add to your net worth when you need a loan from Deutsche Bank?
MAR28	27 MPs robbed us of a people's vote last night. If we want a future for young people, Labour must take it back	Have the two main parties ever been so pitiful? As we face national catastrophe, a dearth of leadership, the lack of clarity and conviction evident in the Commons is astonishing and depressing in equal measure. This time last year, frustrated by the lack of attention being placed on the damaging impact Brexit would have on young people, I co-founded For our Future’s Sake. It was clear even then that the promises made in 2016 were undeliverable.
MAR28	If we’re to avoid catastrophes like Mozambique’s Cyclone Idai, the west must take climate change seriously	According to Mozambique’s president, Filipe Nyusi, as many as 1,000 people may have been killed by Cyclone Idai, which hit the southeast African nation on Friday 15 March. Mozambique’s environment minister, Celso Correia, has described it as “the biggest natural disaster Mozambique has ever faced”. At least 2.6 million people could be affected across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, with 100,000 people at risk due to severe flooding. Cyclone Idai may be the worst ever disaster to strike the southern hemisphere, according to the UN.
MAR28	You may have missed it, but MPs have just passed a law which will save thousands of LGBT+ kids’ lives	I remember my first crush. We must have been no older than eight years old. I didn't of course realise that it was a "crush" per se, although in hindsight it did have a definite sexual flavour. I found everything about him intoxicatingly fascinating – his eyes, his freckles, his trousers – and strategised with considerable vigour (and ultimately some success) to spend as much time with him as possible. I saw myself as being infinitely more accomplished at maths than he, and as such offered to sit next to him and help him with his times tables. I remember I once even lent him my favourite pen. My (albeit rather one-sided) relationship with him is one of my most vivid memories from primary school.
MAR28	Brexit is an endless mess that can only be untangled with a final public vote	So it has come to this. On the very day the country is supposed to leave the European Union and celebrate its first day of “freedom” as “Global Britain”, the Commons is starting again, and the government is trying to revive a deal that has been universally certified dead. The latest wheeze is to chop the prime minister’s deal in half. It is a novel approach to resuscitation, chopping the cadaver in half, and a minor monument to the ingenuity of the government’s business managers. Speaker John Bercow should reject this knavish little trick to evade parliamentary conventions and rules. In any case, the deal does not deserve to pass, and it won’t succeed. It is beyond desperate; a symbolic defeat on what has become a historic day, 29 March 2019 – for all the wrong reasons.
MAR29	Theresa May’s Brexit is over – and a general election is now all but inevitable	There are things about Brexit that, however desperate and damaging, we have come to regard as given. We accept, for instance, that the person most to blame for Theresa May’s terrible Brexit deal failing for the third time today is, in fact, Theresa May. We take for granted that she will try to blame others for this failure. We realise that every day, May and her venal, incompetent government will sink even lower in terms of what they are willing to do, how much chaos they will inflict upon the country, simply to hang on to power­. And we know that the fundamentalist Conservative European Research Group will endlessly bluster and flip-flop in pursuit of its unhinged ideal of a no-deal Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson today voting for a deal they’d repeatedly said was thewful and would turn Britain into a vassal state and a slave state was grotesque, but not at all surprising, such is our rock bottom opinion of both. 
MAR29	We have moved a step closer towards Brexit – but at this rate we may never leave	MPs took Britain a step closer to the EU exit door today, but still refused to decide whether we will actually leave in the end or not.  Theresa May persuaded more than half the 75 Conservative rebels she needed – 41 of them voted with her this time. But she persuaded only two more Labour MPs to switch to her side – Rosie Cooper and Jim Fitzpatrick – leaving her 30 votes short of winning. 
MAR29	‘Vanity sizing’ is no excuse for not knowing your own body shape	Are your clothes making you fat? A new survey shows that women’s sizing varies so much we have no idea of our true shape. Marks and Spencer clothing turns out to be bigger than that of many other stores: waist measurements in garments described as size 10 were considered a size 16 elsewhere. According to the National Obesity Forum, this “vanity sizing” promotes delusions about what constitutes a healthy weight.
MAR29	The government can no longer claim that 'absolute child poverty' is falling - it is time to acknowledge the crisis and act	We all know child poverty is rising. When the government figures are published each year, it’s almost a given that they will show yet another increase in the number children living below the breadline. A few newspaper headlines and a handful of politicians and charities might shout about it, but by the next day the plight of these youngsters tends to be forgotten. The shock factor is gone. This year’s annual data, published on Thursday, was no different. Except this time, they showed for the first time in five years that there has been a rise in absolute child poverty. This is the measure ministers like to use, and the measure that has been on the decrease since 2012, constituting a main pillar of the government’s rebuttal to challenges about poverty – until now.
MAR29	American soldiers aren't dying for our freedom in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They're dying for nothing	President Trump has promised repeatedly to end “endless wars,” during both his campaign and his tenure so far in office. Despite this rhetoric, endless — and, frankly, pointless —wars are, sadly, still the American norm. Two more Americans were just killed in Afghanistan — a war that the Trump administration realises needs to end, but seems in no hurry to actually do so.

MAR29	I tore into the political class on Question Time last night, but I still want to know – why are our politicians so rubbish?	Last night on BBC Question Time, an apt metaphor was given to describe the domestic Brexit negotiation thus far: two cars playing a game of chicken, driving into a head on collision – yet moving slower and slower as they approach. Next chief executive Simon Wolfson’s sentiment certainly wasn’t wrong, but I would say the collision has already happened. Brexit is one colossal car crash.
MAR29	Trump’s critics wanted Mueller to find Russian collusion – but his report leaves them soul-searching	Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to investigate collusion between Donald Trump’s election campaign and Russia, was presented by US Democrats and much of the US media as a paragon of the honourable and careful lawyer. If anyone could get to the bottom of the supposedly murky relationship between Trump and Russia, he was your man.  
MAR29	Theresa May tried one last Brexit – a half-Brexit played out by a marching flute band – but they still said no	Hard Brexit? No. Soft Brexit? No. Smooth? No. No Deal? No. Jobs first? Slow? Botched? Disorderly? No, No, No, No. Hotel California? No. Damaging Tory? No. Red, White and Blue? No. And now, finally, with the Brexit Doomsday clock having run out of batteries and been taken to Cash Converters by a desperate nation to be swapped for eight cans of super-strength cider, there was, finally, one more Brexit to try.
MAR29	Theresa May must give the people a Final Say on the deal, or go down with her ship now	So much for Brexit day, then. The House of Commons delivered a third negative verdict on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on the very day it was supposed to come into effect. The majority against her was much smaller than it was before – but at 58 it remains too high for her, realistically, to have another attempt to carry the house. Speaker John Bercow will be under no pressure to relent and allow her to try it on.  It’s over. 
MAR30	Elizabeth Holmes is accused of fraud on a massive scale. So why is everyone obsessed with her voice?	Teasing Google’s autofill search bar has become a well-worn internet game. Collating the most common questions asked, the search engine attempts to ease your research journey by guessing what it is you want to know about whatever it is you are researching. Start typing “Why do” and you might be offered the answer to the question “Why do cats purr?” Start typing “What is” and you’ll be presented with searches for “a customs union”, “a backstop” or “Article 50”. Start typing a person’s name and what comes up often reveals hilarious truths about our fascination with celebrity. But they can also reveal our private and differing attitudes to the sexes.
MAR30	Boris Johnson didn’t recognise LGBT+ rights in British territories – but a court case has changed all of that	When does a pattern of behaviour end up being a policy? Something that intimately defines a person’s beliefs? The victory of Chantelle Day and Vickie Bodden Bush establishing their right to marry one another in the Cayman Islands reveals much about Boris Johnson, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office he presided over, and the culture he nurtured there. The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory. The UK is accountable for their good government and, ultimately, they are governed from the FCO’s HQ in King Charles Street. The foreign secretary is responsible for them.
MAR30	Children should be taught about the law on equal rights	The protests against teaching about LGBT+ rights in Birmingham schools have elicited an embarrassed silence among many liberals. While everyone favours the teaching of universal human rights, the fear is that condemning the intolerance of Muslim parents could help to stoke Islamophobia.  As a defender of liberal values, The Independent feels bound to speak up. It ought to go without saying that we defend equal rights, freedom from discrimination and the potential of education to free people from prejudice. We also support the right of parents to bring up their children as they see fit, and to decide how they should be educated. 
MAR30	The Top 10: Songs That Mention Other Songs	Rob Hutton started this list with “Thunder Road”, in which Bruce Springsteen is listening to Roy Orbison singing “Only The Lonely”. Mutablejoe objected that the lyric is: “‘Roy Orbison singing for the lonely.’ It's pure speculation on your part that the song is 'Only The Lonely'. This is typical of today’s MSM.” While the committee retired to considered its ruling, it approved 10 more, in no particular order.  1. “We Belong Together”, Mariah Carey, cites Bobby Womack’s “If You Think You’re Lonely Now”. Nominated by Esther Webber. 
MAR30	We're overdue a global recession — and Lyft and its unicorn friends are nudging us closer every day	Whatever your thoughts on ride-sharing companies, the tech sector in general or, indeed, the broader economy, you can’t accuse Uber rival Lyft of being short on ambition.  This morning the company celebrated its stock market debut in New York, having successfully flogged shares to delighted investors who had been starved of the opportunity to buy into a tech-flavoured stock market newbie for some time.
MAR30	Millionaire neighbours Robbie Williams and Jimmy Page have fallen out over building work. It sounds so familiar	There are some advantages to life in the slow lane. When you could be living next door to one of the two neighbours from hell, veteran rock legend Jimmy Page and pop singer (“Let me entertain you”) Robbie Williams, sometimes it’s better to live a humbler life. An existence, perhaps, in which your biggest concern might be the local cat that wees in your garden or the gaping holes in communal fencing allowing foxes to deposit half eaten jars of peanut butter on your lawn. There are benefits to living in an area where nobody can afford a mega-basement; where most residents are stressing over whether they can afford to stick a dormer window in the attic for their millennial offspring to have a bedsit at home.
MAR30	Theresa May’s appalling legacy will be the total destruction of the Good Friday Agreement	A German general once explained that he divided officers looking for promotion into four categories: the clever and lazy, the clever and industrious, the stupid and lazy and the stupid and industrious. He said that the clever and lazy should be appointed to senior leadership positions because they could take important decisions without trying to interfere with the work of others. The clever and industrious should be made their deputies. The stupid and lazy should be sent to the front line, but the stupid and industrious should be pushed out of the army immediately because they are a danger to everyone.
MAR30	The far right paint Muslims as the enemy of the LGBT+ community – but they are the real danger	In the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacre, there has been a collective reckoning of the serious Islamophobia problem we have in the west. Since 9/11, anti-Muslim rhetoric has become a norm within popular discourse, something we’ve grown so accustomed to that at times we don’t even notice it. But for the far-right, it’s much more than just prejudice – it’s the entire basis of their ideology. Over the past few years the far-right have packaged Islamophobia in a particularly insidious manner. Ignoring fascism’s own history of intolerance and profound hatred of liberalism, certain segments of European far-right parties have decided to fashion themselves as the true champions of progressive ideals – while rendering Muslims the menace to us all.
MAR30	The amateur dramatics in the House of Commons make us even worse than Trump	The rules of civilised debate seem to have changed. No longer do we hear speakers promoting their causes through persuasive arguments. Now it is essential simply to point out how scary the alternatives are. Have we really come to this? The amateur dramatics currently playing out in the House of Commons make us the laughing stock of the world. It even beats Trump’s tweets.
MAR30	I am starving myself until Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan is taken out of solitary confinement	As the communities in Syria and Iraq were celebrating the territorial defeat of the so-called Islamic State caliphate last week, I too was rejoicing watching the historic images of dancing women and men, after years of violence, enslavement and oppression. When the Syrian Democratic Forces declared their victory over Isis, I was on the 98th day of my hunger strike. As a Kurd, my commitment to a world of justice, equality and democracy forced me to leave Turkey and become a political refugee in the United Kingdom 15 years ago. I have been living in Newport, Wales, since 2014, where I am actively involved in struggles for coexistence and equality.
MAR31	I'm glad there's an online thirst-fest over Andrew Scott’s Fleabag character. It proves gay actors can play hetero heartthrobs	Do you watch Fleabag? If you don’t you really should, because it’s very good. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the show’s star and creator, is a genius. As in, an actual genius, much more so than many of the old men we see in oil paintings but don’t know quite what they did to deserve such a fancy gold frame. This month, the show returned for a second series. Expectations were even higher, given its incredible first series and the success of Killing Eve, which Waller-Bridge also wrote. Though again it has surpassed expectations. Part of the reason why Fleabag’s second series is delighting viewers is its roster of new cast members, such as Kristin Scott-Thomas.
MAR31	This Mother's Day, consider the 'have nots' who find this the hardest day of the year	Many of us are typically dismissive of Valentine’s Day since it holds no obvious value to those without a partner. In recent years, groups of female friends have celebrated the alternative, “Galentine’s Day” and people send cards to friends or family members instead. Mother’s Day, or Mothering Sunday as it is traditionally known, presents less of an issue at surface level because while you may not be a mother, everyone has a mother so it seems a fairly innocuous celebration. But the many non-GDPR compliant emails from retailers which have flooded my inbox since the beginning of March have outed many of us with severed ties to both. In the space of a decade I became estranged from my mother after she disapproved of my husband. My daughter Annie died a few hours after she was born and my husband and I divorced, meaning his mother, who smashed all the mean mother-in-law stereotypes, was suddenly no longer in my life. For me, Mother’s Day is fraught with the anxiety of knowing what I should be doing on that day, or at least what everyone else seems to be up to.
MAR31	Children should be taught about the law on equal rights	The protests against teaching about LGBT+ rights in Birmingham schools have elicited an embarrassed silence among many liberals. While everyone favours the teaching of universal human rights, the fear is that condemning the intolerance of Muslim parents could help to stoke Islamophobia.  As a defender of liberal values, The Independent feels bound to speak up.

MAR31	We are living in a parallel world where the BeLeave campaign's illegal finances don't even matter. Here's why	If a genie granted me one technological wish, it would be this. Whenever anyone alighted on a column such as this, their smartphone, tablet or laptop would emit a puff of gas that caused total amnesia about all the previous ones. Ad chuck-your-guts-up-until-the-throat’s-red-raw nauseam, you’ve read bozos like me reference fantasy fiction to express the Brexincredulity you feel yourself.
MAR31	Elizabeth Holmes is accused of fraud on a massive scale. So why is everyone obsessed with her voice?	Teasing Google’s autofill search bar has become a well-worn internet game.

MAR31	Taking another look at austerity would yield better results in knife crime than stop and search	What might the UK be talking about if it were not consumed by Brexit? The word “crisis” is overused, though not in the case of the turmoil surrounding leaving the EU. It is also a fair description of the horrific rise in stabbings on our streets, which would surely have received much more attention from our politicians and media in a non-Brexit era. Not before time, the government is now addressing knife crime. It will be easier for police in England and Wales to use stop and search powers under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, under which for a limited period in a given area people can be searched to prevent violent crime. Inspectors, rather than more senior officers, will be able to authorise this tactic in seven regions accounting for more than 60 per cent of knife crime – London, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and South Wales.
MAR31	I believe the LGBT lessons protest in Birmingham was spearheaded by white right wingers, not Muslims	I have a hunch that the demonstrations at the Birmingham school are spearheaded by white right wingers with an interest in stirring discontent. I do not for one minute believe that the majority of practising Muslim parents are party to the protests. So, thank you, Andrea Carlo, your article has filled the gap I have just complained about. We need more like you! Joanna Pallister Address supplied
APR1	Another parliament deadlock puts soft Brexit at risk – as Nick Boles provides a moment of drama	The House of Commons on Monday night rejected all the Brexit Plan B options before it for a second time. It is a big setback for supporters of a soft Brexit. Theresa May will breathe a sigh of relief that MPs have again said what they are against, but not what they are for. It was a missed opportunity for MPs to take the reins. Although the risk of failure was clear, they did not get their act together. Too many MPs voted for their favourite option and against others. For example, some backers of a Final Say referendum did not support a customs union.
APR1	Trump's failure to understand Central America is dangerous — at least the Mexican president can act like an adult	Mexico is on the brink of a major humanitarian crisis and the president is gunning for it. The so-called “mother of caravans” with over 20,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, is supposedly preparing to head for Mexico in the coming days, but the country doesn’t have the institutional resources to support so many people as they wait to apply for asylum in the US.  The northern border city of Tijuana declared a crisis in November 2018, after 5,000 migrants looking to apply for asylum in the US were forced to wait there instead of being allowed to cross legally into the US and apply.
APR1	This summer, I'll attend the wedding of a child bride in the Deep South — the same place where my 32-year-old friend is a grandmother	One day this summer, in the sweltering heat of exurban Atlanta’s Deep South Side, south of Jonesboro but north of Macon where the white flight went, a 16-year-old girl will be kissed for the first time by her beau.  It won’t be in a parked car after seeing some new superhero blockbuster at the multiplex; no, she’ll be kissed as a bride, afterwards to begin her life as a housewife living in a guest house behind her parents’ home with her new husband. Her parents are not only totally OK with this, but they’re happily planning the reception and will be signing for her to get her marriage license along with a local judge. She’s already dropped out of school, I heard.
APR1	Children should be taught about the law on equal rights	The protests against teaching about LGBT+ rights in Birmingham schools have elicited an embarrassed silence among many liberals. While everyone favours the teaching of universal human rights, the fear is that condemning the intolerance of Muslim parents could help to stoke Islamophobia.  As a defender of liberal values, The Independent feels bound to speak up. It ought to go without saying that we defend equal rights, freedom from discrimination and the potential of education to free people from prejudice. We also support the right of parents to bring up their children as they see fit, and to decide how they should be educated. 
APR1	This Mother's Day, consider the 'have nots' who find this the hardest day of the year	Many of us are typically dismissive of Valentine’s Day since it holds no obvious value to those without a partner. In recent years, groups of female friends have celebrated the alternative, “Galentine’s Day” and people send cards to friends or family members instead. Mother’s Day, or Mothering Sunday as it is traditionally known, presents less of an issue at surface level because while you may not be a mother, everyone has a mother so it seems a fairly innocuous celebration. But the many non-GDPR compliant emails from retailers which have flooded my inbox since the beginning of March have outed many of us with severed ties to both. In the space of a decade I became estranged from my mother after she disapproved of my husband. My daughter Annie died a few hours after she was born and my husband and I divorced, meaning his mother, who smashed all the mean mother-in-law stereotypes, was suddenly no longer in my life. For me, Mother’s Day is fraught with the anxiety of knowing what I should be doing on that day, or at least what everyone else seems to be up to.
APR1	A year on, people in Gaza are losing hope in the rallies after endless death and destruction	The Palestinian groom, Walid, was preparing his new marital home for his wedding in a few weeks’ time when the family heard the “knock on the roof”.  An non-explosive missile had made a hole in the top of the block of flats in Gaza where Walid’s sister, Hiba, and her four children live. 
APR1	If AOC didn't want to be compared to the Tea Party, she shouldn't have thrown her weight behind the Green New Deal	A year ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez held a job as a bartender, engaging in political activism part-time. Now, she's the Democratic representative for New York's 14th congressional district and pushing the Green New Deal, a policy which represents massive government intervention in the US economy.  In a recent MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, Ocasio-Cortez sat down to discuss the GND and make a case for its necessity. She said the country should "have a serious conversation" about the Green New Deal, and that it should happen sooner rather than later.
APR1	If Juncker is tired of Brexit now, a poorly timed British general election will really test his patience	Brexit fatigue has crossed the channel. Rabies and mad cow disease may have found La Manche an insuperable barrier, but the near-fatal blend of boredom, frustration and confusion seem at last have infected even the president of the European Commission. For Jean-Claude Juncker, Mr Europe himself, to come down with the disease of Brexit exhaustion while on a trip to Rome is testament to the virulence of the disease: “With our British friends we have a lot of patience, but even patience is running out,” Juncker said in an interview with Italian public broadcaster RAI. “So far we know what the British parliament says no to, but we don’t know what it might say yes to.”
APR1	Donald Trump is undeniably funny — and that's why we should be on our guard	Let us agree that Donald Trump is not the Manchurian Candidate. A useful idiot for the Russians, perhaps, but not an agent of a hostile power. He has certainly lied about his contacts with the Russians, which gives them leverage, but we must accept Mueller’s collusion that he was not acting in conspiracy with Putin. Let us stipulate as well that he is not Hitler or Stalin, or even Mussolini. He has no ambition to be an engineer of human souls, to change human nature or to commit genocide. His goals are more narrowly narcissistic and mercantile. He will do whatever makes him feel good (and others feel bad) in the moment — or whatever makes him money without reference to legal or moral consequences.   
APR1	We are heading for a long Brexit delay – and even ERG MPs are resigned to the fact	Following the third defeat of the prime minister’s flawed Brexit deal last week, a long extension to the Article 50 process has increased in possibility. Why?  Practically, it is hard to envisage how parliament will be able to come to consensus on a way forward and pass into law all of the primary and secondary legislation required to prepare the ground for the UK’s departure from the EU (if it ever happens).  
APR2	Does Theresa May really think Jeremy Corbyn is stupid enough to walk hand-in-hand with her to a Tory Brexit?	Yet again she got the lectern out. Yet again she let us down. No general election. No second referendum. No immediate resignation. She said – relatively – little of real consequence, turned on her heel and didn’t take questions. She’s going for yet another meaningful vote. What a bore. Another anti-climax, then, from the queen of the let down, Theresa May. She really is debasing the currency of the set-piece Downing Street statement. It used to be reserved for declarations of war or general elections or tearful prime ministerial resignations. Next time she'll probably make a solemn promise to get the next round in.
APR2	Alyssa Milano is a feminist force to be reckoned with — unless you're her friend Joe Biden	Alyssa Milano is a feminist icon. From her fierce, feminist acting on Charmed to her bold takes on Donald Trump, her work with Time’s Up, demands for Brett Kavanaugh to be held accountable, and her activism against draconian abortion laws, Milano is a force to be reckoned with if you’ve been accused of assault.  Unless, of course, you’re her friend, Joe Biden. 
APR2	My abortions brought me my daughter. That's what pro-lifers in Georgia and Mississippi don't understand	With the recent passage of foetal heartbeat bills in both Georgia and Mississippi inflicting fear for the safety of women’s lives and their constitutional right to have an abortion, I’ve been thinking about my own. And I realised that without having had those procedures, I probably wouldn’t have my daughter. The daughter who I believe helped to save my life.     I’m a product of a Catholic upbringing. Just like sex, abortion was never discussed in our family, so in my mind, it wasn’t considered an option. Thirteen years of parochial schooling also contributed to this belief.  
APR2	I helped Coronation Street capture the reality of Carla Connor’s psychosis. I’ve seen firsthand that soaps can be radical trailblazers	How many of us feel proud when we own up to our soap-viewing habits? It’s more likely something we tend to feel embarrassed about. Like admitting your favourite movie is Love, Actually or that your Spotify playlists are full of the Spice Girls. Could that be because soap operas, rom-coms and pop music are sometimes not perceived to be especially challenging? Because we think they’re not pushing the envelope in the same way that Black Mirror, The Shape of Water or Pink Floyd did?
APR2	Children should be taught about the law on equal rights	The protests against teaching about LGBT+ rights in Birmingham schools have elicited an embarrassed silence among many liberals. While everyone favours the teaching of universal human rights, the fear is that condemning the intolerance of Muslim parents could help to stoke Islamophobia.  As a defender of liberal values, The Independent feels bound to speak up. It ought to go without saying that we defend equal rights, freedom from discrimination and the potential of education to free people from prejudice. We also support the right of parents to bring up their children as they see fit, and to decide how they should be educated. 
APR2	This summer, I'll attend the wedding of a child bride in the Deep South — the same place where my 32-year-old friend is a grandmother	One day this summer, in the sweltering heat of exurban Atlanta’s Deep South Side, south of Jonesboro but north of Macon where the white flight went, a 16-year-old girl will be kissed for the first time by her beau.  It won’t be in a parked car after seeing some new superhero blockbuster at the multiplex; no, she’ll be kissed as a bride, afterwards to begin her life as a housewife living in a guest house behind her parents’ home with her new husband. Her parents are not only totally OK with this, but they’re happily planning the reception and will be signing for her to get her marriage license along with a local judge. She’s already dropped out of school, I heard.
APR2	If Trump looked at the real facts about immigrants, he'd want the US-Mexico border opened entirely	Last week, President Trump threatened to shut down the “border, or large sections of the border” unless Mexico stops “all illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern border.” This comes on the heels of $1 billion in Pentagon funding for new wall construction, all on top of the 600 miles of fencing on the US-Mexico border that stands already — a product of the 2006 Secure Fence Act. Before getting his funding, the President vetoed a congressional resolution that rescinded his national emergency declaration at the border, saying that rejecting the border fence is “dangerous” and “reckless.” Apparently, the Pentagon agrees. While there are important worries about executive overreach here, not even a more traditional route of policy-making could justify closing the borders or building new fencing.
APR2	President Erdogan’s biggest enemy is Turkey’s failing economy – not Ekrem Imamoglu	It is usually a sign of trouble when the more minor personalities in a nation’s politics become globally famous. So, for example, is the case with the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, a global star thanks to Brexit. So, too, with his counterpart in Venezuela, acting president Juan Guaido. So too, perhaps, for Ekrem Imamoglu, newly elected mayor of Istanbul. Usually Turkish municipal elections stir relatively little interest outside the country’s borders. But Mr Imamoglu’s achievement is notable because he has seized power in Turkey’s largest city for the opposition People’s Republican Party (CHP) from the ruling Justice Development Party (AKP). It was one of a number of unexpected setbacks for Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan throughout the main cities, including in the capital, Ankara. The Kurdish-led leftist People’s Democratic Party (HDP) also made gains in eastern Turkey. That will annoy the president even more.
APR2	Starbucks has offered to pay their staff’s university fees – and it will have a bigger knock-on effect than you think	When Starbucks offers a university education for most of its employees for free, you know something big is afoot. Firms in the US and indeed the UK have long helped to pay for university for selected students, the idea being that they then go on to work for the company. It is a recruitment tool. But this scheme is bigger in scope and different in aim.
APR2	Forget Brexit for a moment, has Theresa May done enough to stop the Tories from imploding?	 The Conservative Party is no stranger to internal division, particularly over Europe. It has been the downfall of many a Conservative prime minister. But the last few weeks have been some of the most divisive it has ever experienced. 
APR3	Wind turbines don't cause cancer, Donald Trump — but these policies of yours do	In any other timeline, the US president claiming — without any evidence — that a major source of renewable energy causes cancer would be the subject of serious scrutiny and concerned questioning. In our world, however, it’s just another day with Donald Trump in the White House. 
APR3	The House of Commons is so divided on Brexit it has had its first tied vote for decades	There hasn’t been a genuine tied vote in the House of Commons for 39 years.* The last time was in January 1980, when MPs voted on the question of whether to allow TV cameras into the chamber. That vote was tied with 201 votes for and against, and the deputy speaker, Bernard Weatherill, used his casting vote against the proposal.  Weatherill used the same precedent invoked by John Bercow today, that the speaker’s casting vote should not make a decision. The result of Weatherill’s vote was to delay the televising of Commons proceedings until 1989. 
APR3	As Labour MPs who support Jeremy Corbyn, we urge him to make a referendum his bottom line in talks with Theresa May	Dear Jeremy, In a desperate move by a Prime Minister who has run out of options, the Labour Party has been invited to enter negotiations with Theresa May about reaching cross-party agreement on a Brexit deal. With no support in parliament or in her own party, the Prime Minister has turned to Labour to bail her out.
APR3	Let the Justin Trudeau scandal be a lesson: seemingly pristine leaders will always let us down	Must our politicians disappoint? That is the question that is keeping some of us on the liberal left up at night. The latest let down is Justin Trudeau. He of the bilingual social media, refugee welcoming press stunts and (somewhat performative) feminism. While Trudeau was never as left wing as many of us economically, his leadership style on social issues did seem like a breath of fresh air. He appeared to be willing to take action that went against the narrative of the day, making genuinely tough decisions on issues like immigration where the easy option would have been to turn people away.
APR3	Urgent investment needed to preserve one of Africa’s largest protected areas	African nations face some of the planet’s toughest challenges. For example, despite contributing little to global warming, Mozambique suffered horrific destruction when Cyclone Idai tore through the country last month. At the same time, the country’s once-bountiful wildlife is under constant threat from poachers working for international organised crime syndicates.  Nearly half of Mozambique’s elephants were killed for their ivory in the five years up to 2015, a crisis that saw the population plummet from over 20,000 to an estimated 10,300.   Within Mozambique’s largest national park–- the Niassa National Reserve – one of Africa’s last remaining unspoilt wildernesses, the crisis struck a bit later and harder. The elephant population declined massively from an estimated 13,000 to 3,000 by 2018.
APR3	The Windrush compensation scheme is now open for applications	When I became home secretary just under a year ago, I committed to doing everything I could to put right the great injustice suffered by the Windrush generation. These people came to our country to help rebuild Britain after the Second World War, and since then they have worked, paid taxes, and made an immense contribution to our economy, culture and society.
APR3	Britain has the perfect opportunity to strike back against Brunei’s horrific new anti-LGBT+ laws	Brunei has shocked the world by implementing a penal code that allows gay men to be stoned to death. It sparked rapid condemnation and calls for a boycott of luxury hotels owned by the state, but the motives for the new laws run deep and the response will need sharper teeth. I was born in Brunei and spent the first 16 years of my life there. For as long as I can remember everything seemed to be running smoothly on the surface. The oil-rich sultanate of 400,000 people on the northern tip of Borneo is one of the largest producers of oil in Asia. That meant Bruneians and immigrants, like my family, did not have to pay income tax, and benefited from subsidised education and healthcare.
APR3	Theresa May is trying to taint Jeremy Corbyn with the Brexit blood – but there is a way he can avoid her trap	When the Conservatives ensured their Liberal Democrat partners shared the blame for the coalition’s spending cuts, Lib Dem ministers admitted they were “dipping our hands in the blood”. The same motive in part explains Theresa May’s surprise olive branch to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. Yes, she needs Labour votes to get it over the line. But if she fails to reach a compromise with the Labour leader in their talks starting this afternoon, the Tories have the option of reverting to type and accusing Corbyn of wrecking Brexit. 
APR3	Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed never to agree to anything	Five days after the UK was meant to leave the European Union, and with exactly one week to find a way out of the Brexit mess that has been entirely beyond her for the last three years, Theresa May has had a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn. It went on for two hours, this meeting. And what did the two of them resolve? They resolved to have another meeting. Indeed they resolved to have several more meetings. And that’s it.
APR3	The latest Brexit drama in parliament is a sign MPs simply do not trust the prime minister to keep her word	There is nothing intrinsically ridiculous about a vote in the House of Commons ending in a tie. It is rare, and result is determined by the casting vote of the speaker, based on well-established precedents which err towards the status quo. Where the Commons tied vote acquires its satirical edge is the fact that it was a vote about voting – allocating more parliamentary time for the “indicative votes” process to continue. Thus our MPs showed their constituents and indeed the whole world that they cannot even decide about how to decide Brexit. It really is that bad.
APR4	I saw Unplanned, the pro-life movie beloved of Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. It painfully aborted two hours of my life	It’s a rare movie that receives glowing accolades from the vice-president, the president's large adult son and Senator Ted Cruz, but Unplanned was the recipient of a trifecta of Twitter praise this weekend.  You may wonder why all three MAGA celebrities chose to support the same anti-choice movie, which is based on a memoir by a woman who went from working at Planned Parenthood to praying outside of it.  And indeed, Unplanned is in many ways the MAGAworld’s first true foray into culture wars.  I decided I had to see Unplanned after I subjected myself to the MAGAworld’s trade-show CPAC. At CPAC I was treated to a seemingly endless loop of Unplanned movie trailers, followed by a baffling speech delivered by the guy who invested $1m in the film, My Pillow founder and proud moustache-wearer Mike Lindell. 
APR4	We should welcome the tortuous Brexit debate – better that than fighting in the streets	If you pass the Houses of Parliament this week, or any recent week, you will encounter forests of flags, a veritable library of placards and an ever-fluctuating crowd, shouting, singing, ringing bells, blaring horns, or just standing quietly, rain or shine. You will see Union flags, EU flags, Ukip flags; at least one Welsh dragon, and many more – some flapping from shared poles, others enthusiastically waved. The placards, both printed and home-made, argue for Brexit, and against. This sort of street theatre, varying in extent and decibels, has been there since the day of parliament’s first “meaningful vote” back in January. You remember the one – when Theresa May and her government lost by a record 230 votes, (though it seems a very long time ago since the prime minister and her government were united enough actually to lose anything like a vote together). It has been there through the day of the enormous march – though perhaps not quite as enormous as was claimed – for a Final Say, and through the ceremonial arrival, with pipes and band, of the “March to Leave” on the day, 29 March, when Brexit had been supposed to happen.
APR4	The next ERG-backed PM will try to tear up any EU deal – only a Final Say referendum can stop them	Never trust a Tory.  That’s an article of faith in large parts of the Labour movement. 
APR4	Gender pay gap reporting isn't failing, it's showing us just how deep-seated inequality really is	Midnight sees the deadline for gender pay reporting by our largest businesses. To coincide with this a "free market" think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), has published a report criticising many aspects of gender pay reporting. While they are right that the government’s gender pay reporting system isn’t perfect, they are wrong to say that it hasn’t been an important step forward in securing fairer pay. The IEA criticises the gender pay reports for not breaking the figures down by full and part time workers. It says that because women are more likely to work part time than men, and because part time work tends to attract lower hourly pay, “the results are almost guaranteed to show that men earn more”.
APR4	Brexit has exposed the flaws in the UK’s electoral system – as an immigrant I should be given the vote	The last decade of politics has been shot through with examples of the shortcomings in Britain’s democratic process. In 2010, the hung parliament which resulted in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition led to the poorly planned and ultimately unsuccessful referendum on the Alternative Vote system, which would have finally meant a real if limited break from First Past The Post.
APR4	Brexit is affecting the lives of people who had no say in the decision – we need electoral reform now	When Nicky was in her early 20s, she left her home town of Broxbourne to look for work. It was 1990s recession-hit Britain and jobs were hard to come by. She eventually found one, moved around a bit more and eventually settled down when she got married.
APR4	With seven days to avoid no-deal Brexit, the House of Commons actually flooded	On Wednesday, the start of Theresa May’s meeting with Jeremy Corbyn was marked by an epochal thunderclap over the House of Commons and a sudden shower of a very rare form of ice-encrusted snow, known as graupel. It was, quite literally, the day hail freezes over. And then, 24 hours later, came the floods. Yes, with seven working days in which to avoid no-deal Brexit, the House of Commons actually flooded. They were in the middle of a debate on when and when not to physically restrain children when a great torrent of water began gushing through the ceiling, flooding the green benches of the press gallery, directly above the speaker’s chair.
APR4	Brexit has affected millions who had no vote in the 2016 referendum – we need to change our democratic system now	The outcome of the next few weeks in politics could determine the course of our lives for decades to come. But many of the people who are most affected by the current situation – migrants living in the UK, and UK citizens living abroad – have never been offered the chance to have a stake in our democracy. In general elections and in referendums such as the 2016 EU referendum, UK residents from countries outside of the Commonwealth and Ireland cannot vote. Neither can most UK citizens living abroad.
APR4	Fragile masculinity says meat is manly. If we don't challenge that, people will die and the earth will be irreversibly damaged	The earth is dying, and so are our bodies.  If meat consumption is one of the factors in destroying the planet, giving humans cancer and heart disease, contributing to 11 million deaths worldwide, then perhaps it’s time to look to veganism as a potential solution for both the global health of humans, and the health of the earth itself. But there’s one thing standing in the way: gender politics.
APR4	The NHS is underprepared for a no-deal Brexit – and I am one of the thousands that might die as a result	On Wednesday night, BBC Newsnight revealed some life-saving drugs have proved impossible to stockpile – including those used to treat epilepsy – and that the doctors who had been given this information had been told to keep quiet. Back in January the health secretary Matthew Hancock told parliament that the requisite medicine supplies had been stockpiled in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Last night we learned that was not the case. Currently, a no deal would mean potential shortages of three important drugs for epilepsy, bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain. This would be life threatening for patients.
APR5	I've had a peek at Trump's tax returns — and they're everything you'd expect	Democrats finally issued a subpoena for President Trump’s tax returns this week. Trump said he was “not inclined” to release them. Of course, subpoena power means Trump doesn’t have a choice.  But it’s not shocking that a guy who boasted about grabbing female genitalia struggles to understand the concept of choice.  Ever since that subpoena, liberals have been excited to find out exactly what skeletons are in the President’s closet — metaphorically speaking, of course. For those waiting with bated breath to see what the Donald’s taxes contain, let me spare you the suspense. I’ve had a look at them, and they contain only the expected:
APR5	Labour’s win in Newport West will make the Tories even more wary about a snap general election	Unless they are “sensational”, by-elections usually get a bit overlooked. This is a pity, because they are, as the politicians always say, “real votes in real ballot boxes”, as opposed to mere opinion polls.
APR5	Grammar schools are an ideological sham, despite efforts to reform selection policies	Under the present government, which famously has as its leader a former grammar school girl, the question of academic selectivity has reared its controversial head once again. It was once said by Labour’s Angela Rayner that the prime minister has an obsession with grammar schools, perhaps a consequence – so mischief-makers suggest – of her own school having been turned into a mere comprehensive under an education secretary named Margaret Thatcher.
APR5	My dog is not fat, he has simply ‘overwintered’ well	 
APR5	Mea Culpa: It comes as the so-called Norway option is put on the table	John Rentoul is away this week but The Independent’s drive to weed out errors continues apace. I begin with an update on our campaign to delete unnecessary uses of “so-called”. It often sounds pompous and could imply disapproval of a particular idea. I’m pleased to say I have noticed a significant drop in its usage since the campaign was started just two weeks before Article 50 was triggered in 2017. Make of that what you will.
APR5	I have witnessed Afghanistan's path from war – and cricket is at the heart of a new optimism	I first stepped foot on Afghan soil in 1988, and in the months that followed, I worked from a Mujahideen camp on the border with Pakistan running clinics for refugee women fleeing the Afghan-Soviet war. Then in 2001, with the country in the grip of the Taliban, I travelled to the Panjshir to work in a mother-child clinic. I witnessed first-hand the devastation of a country and its people. Now, just over thirty years after my first visit, there is a positive story to tell. I no longer work with those at the start of their life but instead for those nearing adulthood in a post war-on-terror Afghanistan, supporting education and helping to bring cricket into their lives.
APR5	Harry Kane should lead the England team off if another player faces racist abuse – whatever the consequences	Morning broke today with yet more upsetting headlines about racism in football. England star Danny Rose admitting that he “can’t wait to see the back of football” because of his experiences, most recently in Montenegro whilst on international duty. Only early this week Juventus teenager Moise Kean and teammate Blaise Matuidi were targeted with monkey chants by Cagliari fans. However the majority of post-match discussion has focused on Leonardo Bonucci’s ill-informed statement that Kean should take “50-50 of the blame”.
APR5	There's a major part of the gender pay gap problem that no one is talking about	As companies submit their annual results on the gender pay gap, it’s clear to see that little progress has been made in the past year. Even high profile women are struggling to secure equal pay, with broadcaster Fiona Bruce revealing in an interview that she was once refused a pay rise because a BBC boss said she could rely on her boyfriend's salary. This is shocking, but sadly not surprising.  The gender pay gap persists in part because companies are ignoring one of the biggest causes – one that legislating on equality or positive discrimination won’t fix.
APR5	Theresa May has moved on from losing meaningful votes to writing meaningless letters	It is 22 years since the satirist Chris Morris convinced Southend MP David Amess to raise in the House of Commons the dangers of a new but entirely fictitious drug called cake. One of cake’s side effects, according to no less than Noel Edmonds, was that it “stimulates a part of the brain known as Shatner’s bassoon, which deals with time perception”.
APR5	Brexit’s negative effects are not ‘yet to come’ – leaving the EU has already left Britain crippled for good	Future historians will look back at Britain in the age of Brexit and seek to explain why its people reduced their power and influence in the world in the belief that they were doing the exact opposite. But historians will have to move quickly if they are to have a say because the most important consequences of Brexit are already with us. People do not see this because UK membership of the EU is wrongly discussed as an economic issue when it is primarily a political one. 
APR6	I've had a peek at Trump's tax returns — and they're everything you'd expect	Democrats finally issued a subpoena for President Trump’s tax returns this week. Trump said he was “not inclined” to release them. Of course, subpoena power means Trump doesn’t have a choice.  But it’s not shocking that a guy who boasted about grabbing female genitalia struggles to understand the concept of choice.  Ever since that subpoena, liberals have been excited to find out exactly what skeletons are in the President’s closet — metaphorically speaking, of course.

APR6	Anyone who criticises ‘the elite’ should be asked if they shop at Lidl – I doubt many would even know what it is	If you want evidence that Britain has completely lost the plot, look at the sort of people who’ve been railing against the “elite” or the “establishment” over Brexit while claiming to represent “the people” over the past couple of days.  I’m talking about individuals such as Viscount Ridley, the megabucks hereditary peer and climate change denier who served as chair of Northern Rock when it went belly up and started the fashion for multibillion pound taxpayer-funded bailouts that would cover the cost of several years of EU subscriptions and a lot more besides.
APR6	Please stop assuming I vote Democrat because I'm a Muslim woman who wears the hijab	“You’re going to vote for all the Dems, right?” Rana, a close friend from high school and college, asked me as the midterm elections were nearing.  “I need to do proper research on all the candidates before voting for them all blindly,” I told her. She didn’t seem satisfied with the answer. 
APR6	The Top 10: More Twitter jokes	As is traditional at this time of year, I pause to celebrate the wits of the world’s favourite microblogging website and in particular to praise the genius of Moose Allain, one of its greatest adornments, responsible for half of the following, and for the cartoon above.  1. Does anybody know what the word “delegate” means? Asking for a friend. Moose Allain. 
APR6	Grammar schools are an ideological sham, despite efforts to reform selection policies	Under the present government, which famously has as its leader a former grammar school girl, the question of academic selectivity has reared its controversial head once again.

APR8	Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation proves that for Trump, the buck never stops with him	Another day, another member of the Trump administration leaves.  The latest departure is Trump's Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen. Summoned to the White House on Sunday evening, Nielsen reportedly didn't have any intention of quitting. But Trump wanted her out and so she "resigned."
APR8	Theresa May is sitting on her sofa telling you it’s all going to be fine – it’s time to start panicking	Don’t panic. Definitely don’t panic. Why would you want to panic? It’s only Theresa May, sitting very casually on her sofa, chillaxing in her oak-panelled living room in front of her oil paintings, shooting the breeze with you, me and Joe Public about the latest Brexit lols. Awww, look at the wobbly camera, the low production values, the little chuckle as the actual prime minister recalls the sheer number of times the pesky House of Commons has dang well voted down her Brexit deal.

APR8	Home education may benefit some children, but I can’t help but think it’s secretly all about the parents	Education, from cradle to whenever it finishes, ought to give our children the tools to earn a living and, just as important, be a good citizen. Children need to experience as many different facets of learning as is necessary in order to raise their horizons and be consistent with their abilities.
APR8	The US electoral college system is a failure and the founding fathers would agree	As the presidential campaign heats up, so too has the movement to abolish or otherwise neutralise the electoral college.  Some advocates argue that it was originally established to help less-populated states retain power, or to have every part of the country heard from in electing a chief executive. Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee claims the system was designed to help the slave states.
APR8	Shame on those who rejoiced at the death of a rhino poacher, who was just a poor and desperate pawn of the mega-rich	On 2 April five men armed with rifles illegally entered South Africa’s Kruger National Park (KNP) in the Crocodile Bridge area. Only four returned to their homes. The fifth was trampled by an elephant and his body eaten by one of Kruger’s numerous lions. The four would-be poachers who escaped told the dead man’s wife and children that he had been killed by an elephant but they couldn’t find his body. The family contacted KNP headquarters and the regional ranger there, Don English, launched a search. The man’s pitiful remains were found on Thursday, 4 April.  Most of the body had been eaten by lions, leaving only his skull and a pair of pants. The four accomplices have been arrested and charged with murder. 
APR8	We’re asking too much of central banks – if we’re to boost the European economy, policymakers must step up	 This will be a week of high confusion in British politics, but one of a little greater clarity in European and global economics. Ultimately the latter also needs to be seen as an extremely important issue.  At some stage there will be an accommodation between the UK and the European Union. But the great challenge facing the economies of the developed world – how to boost growth in a world of very low interest rates – will remain.
APR8	The ultra-low emissions zone will fuel class divisions between London’s poorest while wealthy families sit pretty	It’s official – the world’s first ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) has launched in central London. The hope is that older, more polluting vehicles, which are subject to the £12.50 daily charge, will become a thing of the past as a result. And, by the time the Ulez reaches London’s suburbs in October 2021, so will the capital’s air quality crisis.
APR8	The 'Feminine hygiene’ market is predicted to reach $42.7bn by 2022 – but it's doing more harm than we realise	We thought we might see the beginning of the end of unnecessary products when Goop agreed to settle for $145,000 for making unproven scientific claims about its vaginal eggs. It seems not. “Feminine hygiene” is on a roll. The global market is predicted to reach $42.7bn in revenue by 2022 (more than a 6 per cent growth since 2016).
APR8	The DNA testing industry just wants your personal data – it does not care about your wellbeing	The global DNA testing industry is growing at an astounding pace, with experts estimating its value will hit $45bn by 2024. But regulating a market of this size is no small feat. Misleading information, lack of customer support and regular, viral news stories on genetic bombshells uncovered with one single saliva sample mean that now is probably a good time to petition for better warnings and tighter regulations – before things really get out of control. The recent cases of two American women are examples of stranger than fiction DNA stories, both of which you’d imagine would garner support. Sadly that wasn’t the case. Maureen Boesen took a DNA test more than 10 years ago telling her she carried a BRCA gene mutation, one that increases the likelihood of falling victim to breast or ovarian cancer. But it was only after she had a double mastectomy that she learned the results of the test were wrong.
APR8	The people of Libya are barely an afterthought in this naked struggle for control	Who will save Libya? Variously described as a “renegade general” through to “strongman” and full field marshal, Khalifa Haftar clearly believes he is the one to bring order and unity – though not democracy and human rights – to the miserable, fractured, failed state of Libya. From his base in the east of the country, he has already taken control of the oil-rich southern provinces in a blitzkrieg earlier this year. Now, emboldened by his unexpectedly rapid and easy gains, he is set upon capturing the capital Tripoli, and with it the remaining parts of the country he does not yet rule, mostly the old western province of Tripolitania. Tripoli is itself host to four rival militias; while Isis has established its foothold south of the city of Sirte. Human trafficking; modern slavery; rape as a weapon of war; the abolition of human rights; no jobs; no prosperity; Libya has become a kaleidoscope of horror.
APR9	I agree Joe Biden is ‘of a different time’ – that’s why he shouldn’t be president	We are currently “in the age of MeToo”. This phrase comes up often in news items nowadays, as a reminder that men sometimes face consequences for not treating women like people now. This has not always been the case, and so it’s deemed necessary to signal MeToo when talking about sexual misconduct; in doing so, we acknowledge that the actual allegations are nothing new but once upon a time, nobody with any power really gave a shit.  It was in the olden days that Joe Biden came to be – a matter of timing that presents a problem for the viability of his potential 2020 campaign. As the former vice president considers a run for the nation’s highest office, we are having a conversation about all of the instances in which Biden doing things that used to be OK don’t seem to be so OK anymore. He is not being accused of sexual assault or misconduct. Rather, the discussion about whether or not Biden should enter the election centres on a storied history of making women uncomfortable. 
APR9	The Iranian Revolutionary Guards are terrorists — I’ve seen evidence with my own eyes	My childhood was spent learning about the exploits of “Shahid Bakeri” and “Shahid Hemmat”, Revolutionary Guard martyrs in the eight-year war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Every year, from primary school onwards, I cried for their heroic and selfless sacrifices. Looking back, I now realise that I, and millions of children like me, were brainwashed to admire the Sepah — as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is often referred — for their war efforts. 
APR9	Debenhams is on the brink, but is there a retail genius out there who can hold back the online tide?	The demise of Debenhams is a familiar story, though a sad one. But it is one that carries an intriguing twist. The story first, then the twist. Back in the 1950s Debenhams was Britain’s largest department store group. Its ownership changed several times but when it was floated on the stock market in 2006, it was valued at £1.6bn. Three years ago, after a tough decade, it was still worth nearly £1bn. Now its shareholders will probably get nothing. 
APR9	Like most couples, I can't explain why my marriage ended in divorce	The government has announced that married couples will soon be allowed to divorce without having to prove fault or apportion blame. It’s an important step that will remove the legal requirement to rehash and document personal grievances at a time when people are already wrestling with a tsunami of emotions, shattered hopes and dreams, and feelings of loss and betrayal. For couples with children, it can only help the parents to move towards a relatively stable and peaceful truce. Currently, a partner who petitions for divorce has a choice of “adultery”, “unreasonable behaviour” and “desertion” as acceptable grounds for divorce, unless they can prove that that the two parties have already been separated for a number of years.
APR9	If Facebook can censor pictures of disabled people for being 'disturbing', no wonder the government gets away with cutting our benefits	I now have no doubt that we are living in some weird Matrix-style computer simulation like the one that Keanu Reeves’ Neo escaped 20 years ago by taking Morpheus’ red pill. How else to explain a Facebook employee’s explanation for blocking a sponsored post by Ability Access, a page focussing on disability, which invited people to like it. The administrator Simon Sansome contacted the social network in an attempt to find out why his post had been put in purdah. It’s response quite simply beggars belief.
APR9	The US electoral college system is a failure and the founding fathers would agree	As the presidential campaign heats up, so too has the movement to abolish or otherwise neutralise the electoral college.  Some advocates argue that it was originally established to help less-populated states retain power, or to have every part of the country heard from in electing a chief executive. Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee claims the system was designed to help the slave states.
APR9	Theresa May claims Brexit is a choice between a customs union and no-deal – here's why she's wrong	Cut through all the background noise and the facile soundbites, and Theresa May has allowed herself a binary choice between either a customs union or a no-deal Brexit. That amounts to acting either in the least bad interests of the country or, in a desperate bid to keep the Conservative Party intact, knowingly acting in its very worst. That is the measure of the poverty of the prime minister’s ambition, and let me be quite clear that, even if she goes for a customs union, there will be no prospect of any sunlit uplands. It will take us back almost half a century to the bad old days before we signed up to the European project and we were ridiculed as the “sick man of Europe”. 
APR9	The Tories’ own research is telling them young people are not stupid enough to vote for them anymore	For most political parties, when you commission a report asking why young people hate you and it comes back saying it’s because too many of them have been to university these days and so aren’t stupid enough to vote for you any more, it might be time to panic. But, fortunately, this is the Conservative Party we’re talking about. And why panic, when you can just have a leadership contest instead?   
APR9	The Brexit crisis is cracking the veneer of solidarity among European leaders	For the past three long years the institutions and member states of the European Union have displayed a remarkably united front towards the UK on Brexit. Despite some fairly blatant attempts by the British to “divide and rule”, to call in favours and recruit friendly states such as the Netherlands and Sweden for the cause, what we might call the Barnier Line has held firm. Now, almost without the prime minister’s intervention, some cracks are appearing in the edifice of European solidarity. Most significant, they are forming between Paris and Berlin on the best way to handle the chronic failure of the British to formulate a national policy. On the whole, it is good news for Remainers.
APR9	Pro-Brexit MPs are starting to support a second referendum – here’s why they’re right	Time for a little candour. Enthusiastic as I am about the Final Say campaign – because I genuinely feel that the people have the right to be asked their consent to whatever is about to happen to them – I cheerfully admit that most of the people in favour of a second referendum, particularly those running the various campaigns, were, and are, passionate Remainers. What is novel now is an emerging Leave case for a second vote. Now that Brexit seems to be “slipping through our fingers” as the prime minister puts it, it may be the Leavers’ last great hope – to win a popular vote again.
APR10	A Netanyahu-led government is not inevitable – this tight election means another future is possible for Israel	One of the most keenly contested campaigns in Israel’s history appears to have given Benjamin Netanyahu the chance to form a new government – and coincidentally to overtake David Ben-Gurion, the founder of the state, as the country’s longest-serving prime minister.  Although Netanyahu’s Likud party was tied for first place with the new Blue and White party of former army chief Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, Netanyahu has the better odds of cobbling together a new coalition with the smaller right-wing parties. It leaves Israel’s next government looking very like the Likud-led government it replaces.
APR10	AOC and Maxine Waters took a stand against mansplaining in Congress this week — not a minute too soon	Mansplainers, those “let me just explain something to you” dudes we all know and love, have had a pretty rough ride lately. And, honestly, it’s about time. This morning, the headlines told us of yet another round of mansplaining in Congress between Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). During a hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin announced that he had another “important” meeting, to which he was already going to be late. After some back and forth, where Waters made it very clear that he was free to leave, Mnuchin began to instruct her on how to end the meeting.
APR10	Texas is considering the death penalty for women who get abortions. Real pro-lifers like me will oppose it	Capital punishment, without question, should be championed as a pro-life cause.  As Texas legislators debate House Bill 896, which classifies abortion as homicide and allows women who have abortions to be liable for the death penalty, life is not the central tenet of this bill. Fear is. 
APR10	Watching James in the finale made me see why Derry Girls viewers have fallen in love with my city	As series two of Derry Girls drew to a close last night, viewers saw an emotional finale played against the backdrop of President Clinton’s historic 1995 visit to the city, as it stuttered and struggled towards peace. Faced with the prospect of going back to London with his distant mother, James (aka ‘the wee English fella’) decided instead to stay in Derry, following an impassioned speech from his cousin Michelle: “It doesn’t matter that you’ve got that stupid accent or that your bits are different to my bits, because being a Derry Girl, well it’s a f**kin' state of mind.”
APR10	We’re asking too much of central banks – if we’re to boost the European economy, policymakers must step up	 This will be a week of high confusion in British politics, but one of a little greater clarity in European and global economics. Ultimately the latter also needs to be seen as an extremely important issue.  At some stage there will be an accommodation between the UK and the European Union. But the great challenge facing the economies of the developed world – how to boost growth in a world of very low interest rates – will remain.
APR10	Debenhams is on the brink, but is there a retail genius out there who can hold back the online tide?	The demise of Debenhams is a familiar story, though a sad one. But it is one that carries an intriguing twist. The story first, then the twist. Back in the 1950s Debenhams was Britain’s largest department store group. Its ownership changed several times but when it was floated on the stock market in 2006, it was valued at £1.6bn. Three years ago, after a tough decade, it was still worth nearly £1bn. Now its shareholders will probably get nothing. 
APR10	To the toughest sales pitch in the nation’s history, enter Theresa May, its worst ever salesperson	Theresa May’s mission, in Brussels, was to use the full force of her personality to persuade the European Union to say yes to the thing they told her not to even bother asking for, and have already said no to twice. It’s the kind of sales pitch that the Wolf of Wall Street would never even have attempted. So it was just as well the prime minister arrived with her wondrous interpersonal gifts fully intact, firing out her now trademark 10,000-yard death glare. When she made it to the TV news cameras, she inspected the entirely fair questions put to her by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg as if they were heavily soiled nappies.  
APR10	Changing your mind is a privilege for MPs – not the public. And all these votes on Brexit prove it	It was intriguing to note that leading Brexiteer Mark Francois earlier this week wrote a letter to Graham Brady, the chair of the Tories’ 1922 committee, demanding another vote on Theresa May's leadership of the Tory party. In December, Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote, which was triggered by 48 of her own MPs who had grown disillusioned with her handling of the Brexit process.
APR10	Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election reflects the ever-shrivelling force of Israel’s left	His flaws, his policy failures and his appallingly narrow vision for the future of Israel: all of these are depressingly obvious. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu, arguably the worst leader Israel has ever had the misfortune to be lumbered with, is about to form another government, albeit, in typically Israeli fashion, with an untidy mix of rightist smaller groups in the Knesset. It is, in its way, a remarkable achievement, and one that tells us something about the state of mind of the state of Israel, as well as about Mr Netanyahu’s own extraordinary staying power.
APR10	Why I dressed up as a swamp monster (twice) to troll a Trump Cabinet nominee	Two weeks ago, I walked into Interior Secretary nominee David Bernhardt’s Senate hearing looking like most of the other people in the room. By the time I left, something was different. That’s me in the video, just over Bernhardt’s right shoulder, sliding on a swamp monster mask. My sister-in-protest, Layla Anthony, was on his other side also sitting quietly in her mask, surveying the room to see if Bernhardt himself or the Senators questioning him would notice us. 
APR11	Trump is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to Julian Assange	Early this morning, news broke that WikiLeaks’ co-founder Julian Assange had been arrested by London's Metropolitan Police Service at the Ecuadorian embassy. It was later announced that Assange was arrested in relation to an extradition warrant on behalf of the United States for conspiring with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a classified US government computer in 2010. Assange has been quite an interesting figure for over a decade.  To some he is viewed as a heroic crusader for truth — a man using his First Amendment rights to reveal dark secrets held by the United States and other foreign governments. To others, he is viewed as a danger to national security — an individual getting away with espionage-like tactics by relying on those same First Amendment protections.  
APR11	As a former UK ambassador, I've heard what other countries really think about Brexit. It's not complimentary	The American Congresswoman reeled off the list to me: Basil Fawlty, Mr Bean, Alan Partridge, David Brent. "No-one does comedy heroes like you Brits ... but we preferred it when the characters were fictional."  
APR11	I went to the House Judiciary Committee on white nationalism as an optimistic Muslim — and was disappointed by what I saw	This week the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled “Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism”. As a Muslim and as someone whose research, organising, and advocacy focuses on the War on Terror, I attended this hearing to understand how seriously Congress was going to treat the threat of white nationalism and how Muslims would be represented throughout.  Representative Nadler, the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, commenced the hearing by framing the problem of white nationalism to “Islamist” domestic terrorism.  For some, this might have seemed like an innocent attempt to contextualise the scope of white nationalist violence, but to me it revealed something deeper – the unwillingness or inability to understand the word terrorism as not inherently connected to Muslims.  In fact, the more the hearing drilled down on Muslims, the more it felt like reliving Representative Peter King’s House hearing on the alleged radicalisation of Muslim Americans that was held in 2011. 
APR11	Switzerland just overturned a referendum – there’s no reason we can’t do the same	With a further six-month extension to Brexit and the can being kicked even further down the road, it was intriguing to note that the result of a nationwide referendum in Switzerland had been overturned. The poll, held in February 2016, asked the country’s voters whether married couples and cohabiting partners should pay the same tax. Voters narrowly rejected the proposal, with 50.8 per cent against and 49.2 per cent in favour.
APR11	The middle class is shrinking. Could Labour’s ‘extreme’ economic ideas be the key to saving them?	There are some who will react to an OECD report bemoaning the plight of the middle class by pointing out that there are an awful lot of people who would love to have the problems they’re experiencing. I’m thinking here of those reliant on the UK’s growing network of food banks, a rare growth industry in this country.
APR11	We’re asking too much of central banks – if we’re to boost the European economy, policymakers must step up	 This will be a week of high confusion in British politics, but one of a little greater clarity in European and global economics. Ultimately the latter also needs to be seen as an extremely important issue.  At some stage there will be an accommodation between the UK and the European Union. But the great challenge facing the economies of the developed world – how to boost growth in a world of very low interest rates – will remain.
APR11	There's a reason why Bernie bros and Trump supporters love Julian Assange equally	 Julian Assange, looking for all the world like a younger, scruffier Gandalf, was dragged bodily from the Ecuadoran Embassy in London this morning after finally wearing out the welcome his hosts had extended to him for the last seven years.  
APR11	You may believe Julian Assange is a narcissist and even a bad person. But what played out in London is dangerous for all of us	It is as shocking now as it was when it was first made public.  Footage taken by two US AH-64 Apache helicopters shows them attacking buildings in Baghdad, and then closing in a group of people. The people are not shooting, they are not even armed, though the US airmen claim they are. Two of them are journalists. Several are children.
APR11	The House of Commons had absolutely nothing new to say, and six more pointless months to say it	It’s not yet 24 hours since the European Union staged an intervention on its good friend, Britain and already it’s checked itself out of the clinic and is in the car, driving straight to its dealer’s house. “Don’t waste this time,” was Donald Tusk’s advice, handed out in the small hours of Thursday morning as he granted the United Kingdom six more months to get its life back together.
APR11	The charges Julian Assange now faces in the US will be a marker for how we police our digital age	The removal of Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy caught many people – including perhaps the man himself – off guard. So long had he been ensconced in the Knightsbridge mansion block with Ecuador’s overseas mission that his presence there seemed an immutable fact of global diplomacy. Now, however, he is out on his ear, the Ecuadorian ambassador apparently having become fed up with his guest’s messy ways – not to mention the multimillion-pound cost of providing asylum since 2012 to Wikileaks’ controversial founder.
APR12	Fag in mouth, pint in hand, Nigel Farage is ready to ride his Brexit Party to abject failure	He’s back then. Camel-hair coat, fag in mouth, pint in hand, cheeky chappy banter… Nigel Farage, with no hint of irony, is running for another term as a member of the European parliament, and with a brand new vehicle for his ambitions; the straightforwardly named Brexit Party. He wants to turn the elections into a referendum on Brexit. Good. I want a Final Say referendum. And he’ll lose.
APR12	Is the Conservative Party full of Islamophobes? Consider the evidence we found in our research	Talk of Tory Islamophobia has some way to go before it rivals Labour antisemitism but it is getting louder. This week there was a damning report about Facebook posts by self-identified grassroots members of the Conservative Party, some of whom seem bent on preventing Sajid Javid, the UK’s Muslim Home Secretary, becoming their leader.   CCHQ has pledged to take action against any Tory members who indulge in the kind of noxious and explicit religious hatred revealed in the story, but continues to argue that those who it has suspended (or may go on to suspend), investigate and possibly expel constitute a few bad apples.
APR12	India’s election is a remarkable exercise in democracy; but can violence be kept in the margins?	In India it’s known as the dance of democracy.  After many months of bitter and acrimonious campaigning and in spite of some missed beats on the day, the general election here finally got into full swing on Thursday, with an estimated 93 million people casting their votes across 20 states and union territories.
APR12	Jack Dorsey’s punishing regime of ice baths and fasting is a futile rejection of pleasure	 
APR12	Good riddance to Roger Scruton – now let’s purge the rest of the planning and conservation cabal	I spent a day this week driving around the middle of Norfolk. My deliberately circuitous route followed narrow lanes through vast ploughed fields, the hedgerows bursting with blossom. I noticed that estate agents carefully photograph any property for sale in a way which excludes the next door neighbours.  That’s because hamlets and villages all over the UK are being artificially “grown” – the UK is in the middle of a massive building boom, mostly on greenfield sites, and few people want a bunch of new homes nearby because it diminishes the value of their property. 
APR12	Mea Culpa: a summons for Julian Assange	In our report of Julian Assange being called a “narcissist” by the judge before whom he appeared after his arrest in the Ecuadorian embassy, we said “he had been summoned in 2012 over an alleged rape in Sweden”.  As Philip Nalpanis pointed out, we could have said “summonsed”, which used to be the legal term meaning to be served with a summons to appear in court. 
APR12	Teenagers like me seem to be the only ones brave enough to call for real change	Over the previous two months, young people in the UK – including myself – and around the world have made quite a statement. In the UK during February and March 70,000 young people took to the streets as part of the #YouthStrike4Climate movement, unified under the banner of system change, not climate change. We’ve proven to be the antidote to the climate apathy that’s riddled the political class. We’re creative, imaginative and we’re certainly not bound by the constraints that leave politicians caring more about re-election than the future of our planet.
APR12	When it comes to Brexit, politicians are only respecting the ‘will’ of the white people	With the latest extension to Article 50, the Brexit chaos will probably roll on for at least another six months. We are told that the delays are caused because MPs can’t make up their minds over what kind of Brexit they want. But the truth is that they do not really want it at all. Our elected representatives voted overwhelming in favour of remaining in the EU in 2016 but now feel tied to the inevitable march out the EU.
APR12	This is what Assange was really doing inside the embassy — and what his future Fox News show is going to look like	After seven years confined inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Julian Assange finally made it out — although he was probably hoping for circumstances other than arrest. Seven years in the same building day and night — you might justifiably ask: how on earth did Assange pass the time?  Fortunately, Wikileaks just released the first trove of documents that account for his time in the embassy. The leak includes Snapchat messages exchanged between him and Don Jr (the president’s son favors the rainbow vomit filter, which he calls “Chuck Schumer in art form”, while he apparently insisted Assange use the puppy filter to “show that he’s Ecuador’s bitch”); a dartboard sold at a fundraising auction with a photo of the Clinton family attached, whose winning bidder was a “Mr S Hannity”; a will leaving all Assange’s possessions (his Wikileaks username and password) to his cat; and a haiku about Brexit written on the back of a napkin (Brexit is so cool/ J Assange on team Kremlin/ Got Pam Anderson.)
APR12	Nigel Farage may be a brilliant campaigner, but the Brexit party will soon be over	For those who felt that one Rees-Mogg in public life was ample, the arrival of the even more Eurosceptic Annunziata may come as something of an unwelcome surprise. Sister to the more familiar Jacob, Ms Rees-Mogg seems a marginally more “with it” character than her fogeyish sibling.
APR13	Theresa May appears astonishingly upbeat. Does she know something we don’t?	Theresa May is staring humiliation in the face, about to go down in history as the prime minister who had one job and failed. Her defining task was to take us out of the EU, and now it looks as if it will never happen.  Yet this week in parliament she seemed indestructibly positive, confident and cheerful. 
APR13	Polarising debates around gender dysphoria are deeply damaging for young people – I’ve seen it firsthand	Working in any evolving field of NHS practice can be difficult as well as enlightening. And when it comes to supporting children and adolescents who are experiencing significant concern and distress about their gender, it’s uniquely challenging. The situation is not helped by the highly emotive and often polarised debates about the best way to care for these young people. A number of new clinical and research papers have been published this week, adding to our understanding and reinforcing the complexities of this field of medicine. Across these papers, researchers and staff from the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids), the national NHS service designed to help children and adolescents experiencing distress about their gender, illustrate the wide variations of support needed for gender-diverse young people.
APR13	The Top 10: Consequential Ministers	David Mills suggested this list, of ministers who never occupied a great office of state, which I defined as prime minister, deputy prime minister, first secretary, chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary.  1. Andrew Adonis, education minister, 2005-08. For the academy schools programme. One of my two nominations from the Blair government, he also started the HS2 rail project as transport secretary under Gordon Brown. Also nominated by Daniel Forman.
APR13	I spent years in the fetish and BDSM scene – I know exactly why people die during kinky sex	Today we learned that 22 -year-old Anna Florence Reed died on holiday with her boyfriend. She is the twenty-second UK woman to die in a so-called sex game gone wrong in the past 10 years. The details of this case are for the jury at the trial, not for us to speculate on. But the inescapable fact is that BDSM is an increasingly normalised part of sex.
APR13	Mea Culpa: a summons for Julian Assange	In our report of Julian Assange being called a “narcissist” by the judge before whom he appeared after his arrest in the Ecuadorian embassy, we said “he had been summoned in 2012 over an alleged rape in Sweden”.  As Philip Nalpanis pointed out, we could have said “summonsed”, which used to be the legal term meaning to be served with a summons to appear in court. 
APR13	Jack Dorsey’s punishing regime of ice baths and fasting is a futile rejection of pleasure	 
APR13	Now I know why it took me so long to stop defending Michael Jackson and R Kelly	Worshipping huge pop idols as deeply as a religion is a culture I’m all too familiar with. As an awkward teenager in the early Nineties, I was a follower, led by wherever the cool clique of my generation would take me. R&B and hip hop weren’t just popular music genres – they shaped our identity, beyond just being British south Asian girls.  
APR13	I’m a former Tory MP and I’m registering with the Independent Group. Here’s why	It is difficult to move from one political party to another. A huge chunk of the electorate votes for the same party at every election, regardless of policy. It is particularly hard to make a change when you used to be an MP, with longstanding members as friends, not to mention your history with the party and electoral success garnered over decades. Advancing such a change has been in gestation for several years. In part, it is about policies but these, quite literally, come and go. The real drivers are values, and how they inform policymaking and behaviour. Politics is not an exact science. As Otto von Bismarck famously said: “Laws are like sausages, it is better not seeing them made.” But we do need to know, whatever happens behind the scenes, that the reference point for a politician is a set of values, referred to in choppy conditions as well as smooth.
APR13	Jeremy Corbyn faces an interesting choice – will he demand that the people decide?	For many months Labour’s leaders have hedged and fudged and dodged on the subject of a new referendum on Brexit. Now Jeremy Corbyn must make a decision. The European parliament elections are going ahead.  They could be cancelled, even up to 22 May, the day before polling, if the House of Commons approves the EU withdrawal agreement, but that seems unlikely. Even if the plug is pulled at the last moment, the campaign is starting already and all the parties will have to decide what manifesto they will offer the voters. 
APR13	As we approach the birth of Meghan Markle's child, let's remember the massive disparity in healthcare and birth trauma between white and black women	In a world where healthcare is easier to access than ever before, personal stories such as “I almost died giving birth” and “my health and my babies were in danger” may seem like extreme circumstances. They’re not, however. The world of maternal mortality is closer than it may appear – especially for black women. These are not the words of someone who gave birth without NHS support or without a midwife, but the experiences of two of the most successful women in the world – women with access to the best healthcare available.  In February and September last year, tennis player Serena Williams and artist Beyoncé Knowles-Carter respectively penned essays discussing the trauma of giving birth, both touching on the difficulties of becoming a mother in the public eye. The women were rightly hailed as brave for sharing their stories, yet when the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, announced her decision to opt for a birth away from the prying eyes of the press, she faced furious backlash. It may have been a coincidence that one of Britain’s most visible black female figures would be at the centre of another pregnancy-related firestorm on the same day that Black Maternal Health Week began, but the timing is pertinent. We find ourselves in one of the most significant health crises of our time; why are so many black mothers dying in childbirth, and why don’t doctors seem to care? 
APR14	Nigel Farage has caught his second wind – trivialising his influence now will make him unstoppable	Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water… but you never thought that. The water was perfectly well infested as it was.  Nonetheless, the great white shark of Brexit is visible just off the beach again, and the landscape looks more hellish than it did a week ago.
APR14	Even if Theresa May gets her withdrawal agreement through parliament, Brexit is far from assured	So, last week Theresa May agreed another new Brexit date with EU leaders. It delays the UK’s departure until 31 October. Whether or not this proves to be a trick or treat for the prime minister is unclear. The reality is that even if this “flextension” is enough for May to get MPs to finally back her withdrawal agreement, the PM’s biggest challenge is yet to come – and her Brexit nightmare could continue long after Halloween has passed.
APR14	Why gardening is so much more than a millennial fad to me	My family are one of the lucky few to have an allotment in London. With waiting lists that tend to span years, these plots of land are hard to come by. Hidden in Stockwell, ours seemed like a haven far away from the bustle of the city – and as I child, I loved it. It was full of prickly gooseberries, the most crimson mulberries, sprouting onions and summer strawberries; spending my weekends at our allotment was absolute bliss. As the child of an adept florist, plants and gardening have always been a big part of my life. My mum, with her seriously green fingers and an astoundingly extensive knowledge of botany, can grow just about anything. Whether it’s an impressive arrangement of flowers stuffed with eucalyptus leaves, or an array of plant shoots, herbs or flower clippings, it always seemed inevitable that my mum’s love of plants and gardening would rub off on me.
APR14	I spent years in the fetish and BDSM scene – I know exactly why people die during kinky sex	Today we learned that 22 -year-old Anna Florence Reed died on holiday with her boyfriend. She is the twenty-second UK woman to die in a so-called sex game gone wrong in the past 10 years. The details of this case are for the jury at the trial, not for us to speculate on. But the inescapable fact is that BDSM is an increasingly normalised part of sex.
APR14	The Top 10: Consequential Ministers	David Mills suggested this list, of ministers who never occupied a great office of state, which I defined as prime minister, deputy prime minister, first secretary, chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary.  1. Andrew Adonis, education minister, 2005-08. For the academy schools programme. One of my two nominations from the Blair government, he also started the HS2 rail project as transport secretary under Gordon Brown. Also nominated by Daniel Forman.
APR14	Jack Dorsey’s punishing regime of ice baths and fasting is a futile rejection of pleasure	 
APR14	Polarising debates around gender dysphoria are deeply damaging for young people – I’ve seen it firsthand	Working in any evolving field of NHS practice can be difficult as well as enlightening. And when it comes to supporting children and adolescents who are experiencing significant concern and distress about their gender, it’s uniquely challenging. The situation is not helped by the highly emotive and often polarised debates about the best way to care for these young people. A number of new clinical and research papers have been published this week, adding to our understanding and reinforcing the complexities of this field of medicine. Across these papers, researchers and staff from the Gender Identity Development Service (Gids), the national NHS service designed to help children and adolescents experiencing distress about their gender, illustrate the wide variations of support needed for gender-diverse young people.
APR14	If MPs truly value democracy, boycotting the European elections is the last thing they'll do	Since their introduction in 1979, elections to the European parliament in the UK have rarely been about Europe. They have often been seen by a third of voters who bother to take part as an opportunity for a free kick at the governing party. The elections due to take place on 23 May will be different. They will go ahead unless Theresa May can persuade the Commons to endorse her Brexit deal or a version of it, which looks unlikely.
APR14	Forget Corbyn, David Lammy has what it takes to steer the Labour Party in the right direction	David Lammy is a breath of fresh air when it comes to politicians from the Labour Party. Unlike others who go through tortuous contortions with multiple references to party conference motions in answer to straight forward questions, this man simply says what he believes without equivocation.
APR14	Jeremy Corbyn faces an interesting choice – will he demand that the people decide?	For many months Labour’s leaders have hedged and fudged and dodged on the subject of a new referendum on Brexit. Now Jeremy Corbyn must make a decision. The European parliament elections are going ahead.  They could be cancelled, even up to 22 May, the day before polling, if the House of Commons approves the EU withdrawal agreement, but that seems unlikely. Even if the plug is pulled at the last moment, the campaign is starting already and all the parties will have to decide what manifesto they will offer the voters. 
APR15	David Lammy is spot on – the British right is tumbling into extremism and we should call it out before it’s too late	The backlash to David Lammy’s comments yesterday has been entirely predictable and hypocritical. If there’s one thing for which you can rely on Brexiteers, it’s to blame others for the mess they spent years carefully creating. David Lammy told Andrew Marr on the BBC yesterday: “When people are experiencing rising hate and extremism in this country, we must not concede ground, we must fight it and call it out for what it is.”
APR15	Even in the UK, gay people like me still fear being as publicly affectionate as mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband	Pete Buttigieg formally announced he is running for president of the United States on Sunday, making him the first openly gay Democrat to do so. During the rally in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg spoke about how he imagined going back in time to tell his closeted younger self “on that day he announces his campaign for president, he’ll do it with his husband looking on.” His husband, Chasten, later joined him on stage and the two shared a touching embrace. Such a moment between a politician and their supportive spouse is hardly an uncommon sight, but the fact that it was two men hugging on the podium struck a chord with the LGBT+ community. We cannot understate just how radical these casually loving images are, when in the United States, and here in the United Kingdom, there are many places where a same-sex couple would still think twice before openly expressing that kind of affection.
APR15	With Brexit paralysing our politics, radical action like Extinction Rebellion has never been more justified	The disruption caused by the climate activists of Extinction Rebellion in London today might not have endeared them to people inconvenienced by their non-violent direct action. 
APR15	Italy has edged closer to fascism with a startling attack on academic freedom	We live in an age marked by the return of right-wing, anti-democratic ethno-nationalism, and by the rise of anti-intellectualism. So perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise that the world’s oldest academic institution is facing dangerous criticism from the demagogic far right.  Representatives from Italy’s governing League party in Emilia Romagna have questioned the University of Bologna in the regional assembly because one of its political sciences courses uses an (apparently) “anti-Salvini” monograph. The academic book, written by respected scholars, political scientist Gianluca Passarelli and sociologist Dario Tuorto, is published by Il Mulino, a major publisher. The volume properly labels the League as an extreme right-wing party. 
APR15	Why gardening is so much more than a millennial fad to me	My family are one of the lucky few to have an allotment in London. With waiting lists that tend to span years, these plots of land are hard to come by. Hidden in Stockwell, ours seemed like a haven far away from the bustle of the city – and as I child, I loved it. It was full of prickly gooseberries, the most crimson mulberries, sprouting onions and summer strawberries; spending my weekends at our allotment was absolute bliss. As the child of an adept florist, plants and gardening have always been a big part of my life.

APR15	Jack Dorsey’s punishing regime of ice baths and fasting is a futile rejection of pleasure	 
APR15	Of course Shamima Begum should get legal aid – Channel 4's Derry Girls helps explain why	As we squirm with joy at Channel Four’s Derry Girls, Muriel Spark’s brilliant novel, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie comes to mind. Spark brings to life a gaggle of girls, the “Brodie set”, all of whom have fallen under the spell of their teacher. The troubled Derry in the nineties is replaced by 1930s Edinburgh with the Spanish Civil War providing the backdrop. As with the Derry Girls, religion bumps along with political tensions in the Brodie set’s world. The genius of both is how they capture the headstrong spirit of adolescent girls who remain children at heart. The parallels with Shamima Begum are obvious.
APR15	Sorry Gerard Batten, rape can’t be ‘satire’ when misogynistic abuse is widespread in politics	The notion of rape culture has cropped up time and again in mainstream spaces over the past few years. Yet, we still seem woefully ignorant to what it actually means. This weekend, a comment from Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, inadvertently gave us a refresher.
APR15	Sajid Javid may have avoided ‘a life of crime’ in the traditional sense, but his career choices are still shameful	With the sun setting on Theresa May’s premiership, Sajid Javid has made an early pitch for the Tory leadership with a speech which was supposedly about “crime” but was actually about Sajid Javid. Javid claimed to have been brought up on “Britain’s most dangerous street” and admits he could have turned to a life of crime making “easy money” as a drug-dealer were it not for upright parents, supportive teachers and the love of a good woman.
APR15	European elections will show how Britain really feels about Brexit – of course the government wants to avoid it	It’s amazing how many times in the Brexit process we have been told that something unthinkable or impossible for the government to countenance has come to pass. The prospect of Britain going to the polls on 23 May to elect MEPs is the latest such example. But how likely is it? We shouldn’t underestimate how strong the desire of both main parties to avoid the elections will be.  
APR16	Bill Weld: The simple, sad reason why he will never defeat Donald Trump	The path to taking the GOP nomination away from Donald Trump in 2020 is exceptionally narrow, and it certainly won't happen with former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.  Weld announced his candidacy for the 2020 GOP presidential nomination today, saying in a statement, "Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their 'win at all cost' battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored, and our nation is suffering."
APR16	Why are we mourning Notre Dame? Because in a world of disposable things, historic, sacred spaces are all we have	It seems the cruellest of ironies: an edifice constructed over the span of centuries, consumed by flames and streamed in real time to an audience of hundreds of millions. The fire at Notre Dame de Paris is out, with much of its treasures saved. The roof is gone but efforts are already underway to fundraise for its replacement, and steps being taken to prevent such a calamity from happening again. Now, perhaps, we can pause for a moment and consider just how essential cathedrals – and historic parish churches, for that matter – are in providing a space apart and a place of perspective in a distinctly unsettled world.
APR16	Jeremy Hunt's new Brexit lies are playing Bannon's game, and driving British politics into the shadows	As Notre Dame burned, the UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt reached for his phone, and diplomatically tweeted his sympathy. “Thinking of all our friends in France tonight following the devastating fire … heart-breaking for the millions who love this great cathedral and great city across the world.” Similar messages poured in from around the globe – from Donald Trump’s monomaniacal advice on how to put out the fire, to the more compassionate thoughts of those blessed with empathy, such as Angela Merkel who, rarely for someone who likes to speak publicly in German despite being fluent in several languages, expressed her sympathy in French.
APR16	Egypt is slipping dangerously far from democracy as the West waves through a Sisi dictatorship	By the time April is over, general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi may be a de facto ruler for life. The constitutional amendment bill passing through the Egyptian parliament on Tuesday will change the term limits for the presidency: it will allow Sisi to remain in power until at least 2030, when he will be 76 years old.  These amendments gift general-turned-president Sisi unimaginable power over our country. Providing his bloated military even greater control over the economy, and the authority to police the political sphere if the “civilian nature of the state is under threat” – whatever that means. 
APR16	It's not fake reviews you need to worry about online, it's people who don't know what they are talking about	Amazon may be flooded with fake reviews and it is certainly a worry that platforms carry supposedly five-star reviews that have been generated by some computer on the other side of the planet. But actually it’s not fake reviews that we need to worry about when shopping online. It is people who don’t really understand what they are talking about. We live in a world where people trust “real” reviewers rather than experts. So we choose a restaurant on the basis of its rating by hundreds of people who have eaten there, rather than the review in a guide book or a newspaper column. The same goes for a bit of equipment, a dishwasher or some headphones. We do that because the reviews are more up to date and we think we can usually figure out the duff comments and make allowance for them. The worst that happens is you have a mediocre meal or buy a substandard product; annoying, but not a catastrophe.
APR16	With Brexit paralysing our politics, radical action like Extinction Rebellion has never been more justified	The disruption caused by the climate activists of Extinction Rebellion in London today might not have endeared them to people inconvenienced by their non-violent direct action. 
APR16	What Donald Trump accidentally revealed during his threats to sanctuary cities	“Liberals are freaking out about sanctuary cities,” said Twitter today, through the typed fingers of hundreds of Trump supporters. “Trump got the entire Democrat party to admit sanctuary cities are dangerous,” One America News host Jack Posobiec crowed. Act For America, a self-described “grassroots national security organisation” hoping to “make America safe again”, added that Democrats had said they “want illegal immigrants in our sanctuary cities” but responded with outrage when told by Trump, “OK, here they come!”  “This was a great move,” said a Trump supporter whose tweets are still raking in the likes, “and why Trump is a smart businessman. Call their bluff … Well played, Mr President.”
APR16	The tragedy of Notre Dame should be a warning – we need to look after what was built by past generations	The world watched in horror as one of the greatest symbols of civilisation burned. The cathedral of Notre Dame was a remarkable flowering of the Gothic style, with its high arched roofs and flying buttresses. It is a monument to the ambition, piety, technological advance and splendour of the high middle ages.  One estimate suggests that building the cathedral absorbed about one-fifth of the economic resources of the Paris basin for a century and a half, 1100 to 1250. It was built to last forever, and it was heartbreaking to watch such ancient grandeur consumed by the flames. 
APR16	Notre Dame shows the raw power of the world's great cathedrals – just as the far right tries to hijack Christianity	The moment when the blazing spire of Notre Dame collapsed, to cries of despair from the watching crowds on Monday, has already established itself as one of the most bleak and abiding memories of 2019.  The gilets jaunes riots that have plagued the streets of Paris and other cities since November last year means that the city has been no stranger to scenes of violence and destruction in recent months. But there is something about the collapse of a monument that has endured for centuries that strikes at the core of all of us. You do not have to be a Christian to feel this.
APR16	Macron will have to do more than rebuild the Notre Dame if he hopes to unite France	“Notre Drame” – our drama – screamed the front page of French newspaper Libération this morning and it pretty much summed it up. Paris and the world watched in horror last night as Notre-Dame de Paris, one of the most-visited monuments in the world, a piece of world history and an architectural marvel burned, the flames visible from across the city.
APR17	How to avoid being gaslighted by Trump when you hear what's in the Mueller report	Later today, William Barr, the US Attorney General, will release a redacted version of the Mueller Report. “Redacted”, of course, is a fancy word that means “censored for public viewing.” Because the nature of Barr’s redactions will not be known until the full report is released to Congress, what will appear today is akin to a film adaption of a novel that no one but the director has read. We’ve been down this road before. On 24 March, Barr released a “summary” of the Mueller Report which contained this dependent clause: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” For all we know, the beginning of that sentence is the single word “although.” This did not stop the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, and many other outlets from running with some variation of the misleading headline “Mueller finds no conspiracy” (Trump himself did one better, claiming “complete and total EXONERATION” on Twitter.) 
APR17	I've had a sneak peek at Rudy Giuliani's Mueller report rebuttal — and Julian Assange says I can tell you all about it	At 2.54am on Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani texted Politico’s Darren Samuelsohn that the president’s “counter report” will come out at the same time as the redacted Mueller report and that it will be 34 or 35 pages. Originally, Rudy G had promised to deliver 140 pages of delicious, bodice-ripping, lib-owning content, but as this writer can tell you, there are only so many gifs, emojis and Venn diagrams you can put in a piece of writing before you start to look like you're just trying to fill the pages. Speculation is wild about what will be in the Rudy Rebuttal but luckily for me, Julian Assange sent me an early copy on the condition that I publish it immediately (because that’s what you do when you're totally not a cut-out of the Russian government at all.) 
APR17	Trump's Saudi veto is a disgrace — and a danger — to America	This week, President Donald Trump vetoed the War Powers Resolution, a historic bipartisan attempt by Congress to force the administration to halt US support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen. The Saudis are currently spearheading a war effort that has created a humanitarian crisis in Yemen — one that has killed more than 50,000 people and left millions in dire need of aid. Now, when Congress wants to withdraw US support, Trump decides to make use of only his second veto in office thus far. In his message to the Senate, Trump wrote: “This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.” Not a single word of this is true, and this veto is a disgrace. 
APR17	Slavery was supposed to be abolished over 180 years ago – so why is it rife within modern Britain?	More than 180 years ago campaigners who had fought long and hard to abolish slavery heralded the end of the transatlantic slave trade. The end of slavery in the majority of the British empire was a cause for celebration. But sadly, the party was short-lived. Some of those early freedom leaders knew the job was far from complete, which is why, in 1839 they founded the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to continue their work against slavery in all its forms. Renamed in 1990s as Anti-Slavery International, the charity marks its 180th anniversary today, as slavery still persists – and in fact thrives – in Britain.

APR17	Twenty years after the Columbine shooting, I’ve realised what it means to be an American living in a country with stricter gun laws	I was 11 years old the first time I heard the term mass shooting.  Our teachers shuffled us into our school gym for an assembly. I sat on the hard wooden floor, surrounded by body odour and self-loathing and hormones, as I watched a montage of students running with backpacks over their heads.
APR17	Vince Cable is right: There is still time for Remain parties to work together in the Euro elections	Sir Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, is entirely justified in criticising other parties that share his desire to keep Britain in the European Union. As we report today, the Lib Dems claim to have proposed to Change UK – the party formed by the Independent Group of MPs – and the Green Party that they should unite to fight the European parliament elections together.  “We didn’t get a positive reaction to that, so we are going on our own,” Sir Vince told the BBC. He should not give up so easily. 
APR17	Extinction Rebellion protesters are getting arrested because our political system has left them no choice	Extinction Rebellion (XR) is one of the most remarkable grassroots movements of the 21st Century. Spurred on by dire warnings about climate breakdown, it has mobilised thousands of people who are willing to get arrested, or even face prison, to make their voices heard. How is it that in our supposedly democratic society so many feel compelled to break the law to make such an overwhelmingly reasonable point: that we shouldn’t destroy the environment on which all life depends?
APR17	Brexit was supposed to return control – but for LGBT+ people all it’s done is taken it away	The discourse in the UK surrounding our favourite B word is farcical at best. As a nation, the divisions are running deep and the future of our political institutions are constantly being called into question. But what’s being forgotten throughout is the social impact that, not just the eventual result of Brexit will have, but the environment that the referendum and the turbulent political climate that has arisen as a result, has caused. Brexit was a strong example of how when extreme, conservative views are given a platform and legitimised by a small minority, hate crimes rise and marginalised people grow fearful for their safety in public. What I want to know, is that if Brexit is meant to “give us back control”, then why are LGBTQ+ people, and other marginalised groups feeling like we are losing control when it comes to our safety as a result of the Brexit process?
APR18	The Mueller report is just a US version of the Butler review on Iraq: a glancing blow and nothing more	Officially, William Barr addressed the American media about the Mueller report this morning (Washington time) as the attorney general of the United States. In reality, as the loyal parroting of his boss’s no-collusion mantra made clear, he was speaking as Donald Trump’s personal lawyer; a saner, jowlier, less car crashingly hilarious Rudy Giuliani.
APR18	Potholes and bins can wait: Northern Ireland’s local elections are a constitutional showdown	You know election season is under way in Northern Ireland when politicians are out beating the drum on the constitutional question. Ahead of local elections on 2 May, parties have been unveiling their manifestos, but their rhetoric is not about bin collections and potholes. Instead, the parties are discussing (you guessed it) whether Northern Ireland should stay in the UK, or whether Ireland should be reunited.
APR18	The Mueller report shows we don't have a cunning criminal in the Oval Office - we have a narcissistic imbecile	It’s worse than we thought; on balance, the Mueller Report appears to paint the US president as the perfect idiot, along with members of his team who did Putin’s bidding unbeknownst to them.  The special counsel ends his report with the following, somewhat chilling, conclusion: “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
APR18	Iraq’s wounded and grief-stricken tell a disturbing tale of a divided country after the ‘defeat’ of Isis	The moment the 54-year-old walks up to the car, it is obvious something is terribly wrong. The way he drags his feet, then stamps them on the ground and marches forward like a toy soldier, head lowered; then the way he looks up at you from beneath dark brows, in both greeting and concern. Taamy Wahab Mohamed al-Yasaari should have returned from the Isis battlefront to a land fit for heroes. For the Shia Muslims of southern Iraq, he counts among the heroes. When I ask him when he was wounded, he looks and stares at the wall in a distressed way, dark eyes framed by thick black hair but white beard. “Several times I was wounded,” al-Yasaari says. And you can tell that the bullets and shrapnel have framed a diary in his mind. “On 28 April 2015 at Bayji, on 3 July 2015, again at Bayji, on 5 May 2016 on the Makhoul mountains near Tikrit, then on 3 July 2017 at Khalidiya in Anbar province.” It was the last wound which did for him.
APR18	As a solo mother who chose to become a parent using a sperm donor, Cheryl is my hero	It seems unlikely that a singer worth £20m who spent almost a decade as the face of L’Oreal would have huge amounts in common with the mums at my local playgroup. But among solo parents, Cheryl has become a hero. Her comments that she’d like another child but that “not everything has to be conventional” and she’s happy to use a sperm donor have been condemned in some quarters for being “selfish”. But as a solo mum who used a sperm donor to conceive both my daughter and almost-due son, I am delighted that she’s being so open about how much she’d love to have another child and that it isn’t dependent on finding a partner.
APR18	Trump's Saudi veto is a disgrace — and a danger — to America	This week, President Donald Trump vetoed the War Powers Resolution, a historic bipartisan attempt by Congress to force the administration to halt US support to Saudi Arabia in Yemen. The Saudis are currently spearheading a war effort that has created a humanitarian crisis in Yemen — one that has killed more than 50,000 people and left millions in dire need of aid.

In his message to the Senate, Trump wrote: “This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.” Not a single word of this is true, and this veto is a disgrace. 
APR18	The global elite is destroying our planet. So why are Extinction Rebellion activists the ones in the dock?	It has been hard to ignore the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protesters who have taken over bridges, blocked major roads, planted trees, danced and even temporarily brought a halt to the DLR tube line. Leading on from their naked protest in parliament, they have certainly grabbed the headlines, generating countless column inches (including this one), garnering radio and TV interviews, and, to the chagrin of many of the big green NGOs, sparked more discussion about climate change than years of their campaigning had done. There are rightly many criticisms and discussions about the XR protests, from the whiteness of its mobilisation, the long term viability of building a movement solely around the tactic of “non-violent civil disobedience and disruption”, to the lack of concrete political demands to build broader public support.
APR18	If I was still in the EDL today, being banned from Facebook would have done nothing to deradicalise me	The Christchurch terror attacks were a painful reminder to everyone that ideas matter. As a former member of the English Defence league (EDL) I welcome the news that the government plans to introduce internet safety laws. We should all welcome legislation that encourages social media companies to take stronger action to address the toxic spread of extremist ideas on their platforms. However, because I am a former member of the EDL, I do not envy the choices government or social media companies will have to make.
APR18	MPs have cracked the code to lasting popularity – all they have to do is get into bed with the far right	If you’re a singer, or actor or dancer, you may have an ambition to appear regularly on television, but you face so many obstacles it seems hopeless. So here’s a tip that could help. Take a break to set up a far-right party and make some speeches about Europe and Muslims, and you’ll be on every day for nine years. Tommy Robinson, for example, was prepared to graft like that and now he’s rewarded with regular slots on every news programme. So much so, that you expect to hear: “Now the weather for the northwest, read by Tommy Robinson.” To which he’d likely say: “There’s a right chilly front sweeping through the Lake District, I’m sick of it, decent people are sick of it, we’ve had enough. They say it will be gone by Wednesday at 7am but we can’t trust ’em.”
APR18	The Mueller report shows Trump tried to run a country like a business - and America has to live with the consequences	“Oh my God. This is the end of my presidency. I’m f***ked,” Donald Trump said when he learned about the appointment of a special counsel, we found out after the release of the Mueller report today. Considering this, it’s incredible how the president and his fellow Republicans managed to turn the narrative around after William Barr’s initial statement. After the release of the minimally redacted report today, it will be more difficult for triumphant crows to echo round Congress (not that the Trump-backing members of the Republican Party won’t try.) But because of its nuance – something which we should always have expected from the tight-lipped, leak-proof, anti-sensationalist Robert Mueller – it will be equally difficult for Democrats to use this report as fodder for impeachment or meaningful sanction.
APR19	The tragic death of Lyra McKee shows our carelessness towards the fragility of the Good Friday Agreement	The death of a journalist on the streets of Derry at the hands, it seems, of the New IRA adds a particularly sad and poignant dimension to the latest outbreak of low-level terror on Northern Ireland (by the standards of the worst years of the Troubles). Lyra McKee was doing her job, and it cost her life. It highlights the risks that brave reporters take in every war or conflict, including riots and demonstrations, and we know only too well that journalists are now actively targeted by some groups, and most barbarically by so-called Islamic State and by Syrian government forces. 
APR19	Revolutionaries in the Middle East have learnt crucial lessons since the Arab Spring	Two very different political waves are sweeping through the Middle East and north Africa. Popular protests are overthrowing the leaders of military regimes for the first time since the failed Arab Spring of 2011. At the same time, dictators are seeking to further monopolise power by killing, jailing or intimidating opponents who want personal and national liberty. Dictators in Sudan and Algeria, who between them had held power for 50 years, were driven from office in the space of a single month in April, though the regimes they headed are still there. The ousting of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, now under arrest, came after 16 weeks of protests. Hundreds of thousands continue to demonstrate, chanting “civilian rule, civilian rule” and “we will remain in the street until power is handed over to civilian authority”. 
APR19	Gordon Ramsay’s ‘Lucky Cat’ controversy has inspired me to ignore the bizarre opinions of foodies	Gordon Ramsay caused a stir in the rarefied world of fine dining this week when he opened a new restaurant called Lucky Cat, describing it as “an authentic Asian eating house”.  Food writer Angela Hui complained, claiming she was the only East Asian at the launch (are quotas de rigeur at PR events?), describing it as a real life Ramsay “kitchen nightmare”. Gordon’s crime was to feature something called a mini wagyu pastrami burger topped with Asian chilli jam.
APR19	How recognising Jesus as a victim of sexual abuse might help shift Catholic culture	The crisis of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, and the institutional denial and cover up, has left many people of faith shocked by the lack of appropriate response towards survivors. Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, the president of the Australian bishops’ conference, has called for a Copernican revolution on sexual abuse in the church and a shift in Catholic culture so that abuse survivors, not clergy, shape the church response.
APR19	Mea Culpa: Deoxyribonucleic acid on the Banned List	We wrote of “the national DNA” in a comment article about Nigel Farage’s return from the wilderness, saying that it includes “the presumption … of denying extremists parliamentary seats”. Julian Self wrote to draw my attention to this flagrant breach of my Banned List, the DNA metaphor being one of its prohibited cliches.  For some trait to be “in someone’s DNA” is bad enough, but in a nation’s DNA is too much. 
APR19	Liz Truss is playing fast and loose with the truth as Brexit pushes Britain into bargain bin territory	“Another demonstration the rest of the world has huge confidence in Britain. As do I.” So tweeted Liz Truss in response to a report from consulting firm EY that highlights Britain as a hot tip for international companies on the hunt for deals. 
APR19	The only man who can stop Nigel Farage from sweeping the European elections is Jeremy Corbyn	At a lavish party for Nigel Farage at London’s Ritz Hotel five months after the 2016 referendum, the man himself predicted a “big, seismic shock in British politics” like Donald Trump’s “total revolution” in the US. Farage told the 100 guests – friends, politicians and journalists (including me) – the UK’s problem was “still being run by the career professional political class”. He feared it would block Brexit. With Ukip seen as a basket case, in the margins of the event, his allies discussed launching a new, online-based movement based on Italy’s Five Star.
APR19	The death of Lyra McKee is a terrible loss – and a warning	The symbolism of Good Friday in the history of Ireland is unavoidable. This was the weekend 103 years ago when republicans rose against the British in Dublin. And this was the day 21 years ago when the peace settlement in Northern Ireland was agreed.  That Lyra McKee should have died on this day of all days makes the pain harder to bear. She was shot by a “republican volunteer”, presumably one opposed to what became known as the Good Friday Agreement. We have to assume that her killing was not intentional, but using a gun in such a situation of riotous disorder in Derry was such an act of reckless culpability that she might as well have been murdered. 
APR19	Trump is a cancer on the presidency who put his own needs above a nation’s, he must be impeached	So it turns out that, indeed, President Donald Trump was not exonerated at all, and certainly not “totally” or “completely”, as he claimed. Special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t reach a conclusion about whether Trump committed crimes of obstruction of justice – in part because, while a sitting president, Trump can’t be prosecuted under long-standing Justice Department directives, and in part because of “difficult issues” raised by “the president’s actions and intent”.
APR19	Extinction Rebellion naysayers refuse to see the bigger picture when it comes to climate change	Folk complaining about the recent inconvenience in London reminds me of the East German Berlin Wall guard. When the Berlin Wall came down, reporters asked an East German border guard what he thought about it. “A terrible thing,” he replied. “Now I’m out of work.” Some folk really can’t grasp the bigger picture.
APR20	Theresa May has destroyed the Tory party – and that means Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister	It is only just beginning to sink in how disastrous Theresa May’s failure is for the Conservative Party. The opinion polls have recorded huge drops in Tory support. The most recent from ComRes put the Tories on 23 per cent, which may be an outlier but there is no reason why they should not fall further.  Tory MPs who have been on the doorstep during the Easter break call it the “recess from hell”. The prime minister herself favours a spot of light canvassing when she is off duty. If she found time to knock on any doors in her Maidenhead constituency before or after marshalling a 10-mile run yesterday, it would be interesting to know how that went. 
APR20	Despite promises to get medical marijuana on the NHS, progress has been bafflingly slow. Why?	One of the few rays of hope in an otherwise bleak political landscape last winter was home secretary Sajid Javid’s announcement that medicinal cannabis would be available on the NHS. At the time it seemed like the best possible Christmas present for those parents – most high profile among them Alfie Dingley’s family – who had campaigned for the medication on behalf of their children.
APR20	One year later, justice for my friend Loujain al-Hathloul means a full pardon from Saudi authorities	On an ordinary day almost exactly one year ago, I scrolled through my Facebook newsfeed and saw multiple posts about Loujain al-Hathloul. This was not unusual: we had both graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC), in Vancouver, Canada, I had watched in awe since then as she made international headlines for her fearless activism fighting for women’s rights in her native Saudi Arabia. But on this particular day, the details of the headlines were profoundly shocking: Loujain faced the death penalty for her activism.
APR20	The Top 10: Hits that blindsided experts and gatekeepers	This one came from Ian Leslie’s weekly email newsletter, which is free and highly recommended. He linked to a profile of Elton John, and said its most interesting revelation is that nobody saw “Your Song” coming. “Now, it’s one of the most played and best loved songs of all time, but before it was popular, nobody thought much of it. Label bosses, marketers and journalists just didn’t ‘hear’ it first time round.”   1. “Your Song”, Elton John and Bernie Taupin. “It was released in the US as the B-side to a song that few remember now [“Take Me to the Pilot”]. It was only after a few DJs started playing it that it gained traction,” said Ian Leslie. 
APR20	Revolutionaries in the Middle East have learnt crucial lessons since the Arab Spring	Two very different political waves are sweeping through the Middle East and north Africa. Popular protests are overthrowing the leaders of military regimes for the first time since the failed Arab Spring of 2011. At the same time, dictators are seeking to further monopolise power by killing, jailing or intimidating opponents who want personal and national liberty. Dictators in Sudan and Algeria, who between them had held power for 50 years, were driven from office in the space of a single month in April, though the regimes they headed are still there. The ousting of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, now under arrest, came after 16 weeks of protests. Hundreds of thousands continue to demonstrate, chanting “civilian rule, civilian rule” and “we will remain in the street until power is handed over to civilian authority”. 
APR20	Mea Culpa: Deoxyribonucleic acid on the Banned List	We wrote of “the national DNA” in a comment article about Nigel Farage’s return from the wilderness, saying that it includes “the presumption … of denying extremists parliamentary seats”. Julian Self wrote to draw my attention to this flagrant breach of my Banned List, the DNA metaphor being one of its prohibited cliches.  For some trait to be “in someone’s DNA” is bad enough, but in a nation’s DNA is too much. 
APR20	Britons do work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answer – this is what we should do instead	The UK has been building a bit of a reputation for itself, and I’m not talking about its ability to push back a Brexit deadline. While politicians have been complaining about working overtime, non-politicians across the country have also been busy. In fact, a bit too busy, according to recent analysis by the TUC that found Brits are working the longest hours in the EU, but are on average, less productive. In this context, it may not come as a surprise that our own research shows that over a third (34 per cent) of UK employees feel more stressed now than they did two years ago. Almost one in three (30 per cent) workers who are already stressed think that a four-day working week would relieve stress. In fact, some organisations have already started to put these initiatives into action. For example, an Australian company recently condensed their five-day week into four days, giving their employees a day off on Wednesdays.
APR20	If Corbyn gets into power he can implement socialism, right? It’ll be harder than you think	With a general election potentially on the cards, one of the burning questions of British politics is: are progressives ready to take charge? For the first time in a generation, the UK stands at a political crossroads, with the two major parties separated by a gulf in ideology and values, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour promising a fundamental reordering of politics and the economy. But what would this entail? And how can a radical government stand up to an establishment hostile to any redistribution of wealth and power?
APR20	Thank you to former members of the far right who repent and are brave about sharing their experiences	Ivan Humble must be applauded and thanked for his article on the way radicalisation works from the point of view of an individual. With honesty, clarity and sharp analysis informed by insider experience, he spelt out the deep dangers, born of non-awareness, that may befall attempts at containing the spread of extremist views. Those who have to deal with this problem in a public or private capacity would do well to ponder the points he so lucidly made.
APR20	How recognising Jesus as a victim of sexual abuse might help shift Catholic culture	The crisis of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, and the institutional denial and cover up, has left many people of faith shocked by the lack of appropriate response towards survivors. Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, the president of the Australian bishops’ conference, has called for a Copernican revolution on sexual abuse in the church and a shift in Catholic culture so that abuse survivors, not clergy, shape the church response.
APR21	Amid the tragic attacks in Sri Lanka, the region's growing economy offers much needed hope	The attacks in the churches in Sri Lanka shock us all. For Christians, the great uplifting festival of Easter has been scarred by these dreadful events. For everyone they are a dreadful reminder that people with extreme views can do unspeakable damage to other human beings. Nothing any of us can say can take away the horror of it all. And yet it’s worth noting that in many ways Sri Lanka is a success story. We need to remind ourselves of that. The country experienced 30 years of civil war, ending in 2009. In the decade since then there have been huge advances not just in living standards but also in social and economic opportunities. 
APR21	Theresa May has destroyed the Tory party – and that means Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister	It is only just beginning to sink in how disastrous Theresa May’s failure is for the Conservative Party. The opinion polls have recorded huge drops in Tory support. The most recent from ComRes put the Tories on 23 per cent, which may be an outlier but there is no reason why they should not fall further.  Tory MPs who have been on the doorstep during the Easter break call it the “recess from hell”.

APR21	Celebrity fat-shaming is even more dangerous than you may think – and science proves it	Each of us has a unique relationship with fat. Slim people are consistently lauded for avoiding it, bigger people are shamed for embodying it, and everyone else seems to spend their life trying to walk a fine line and be an acceptable distance away from it. Fat, and our perception of it in relation to ourselves, affects us more than we might think. And so does the public fat-shaming of celebrities. When we witness the widespread mocking or criticism of a woman’s weight on social media or in the mainstream press, we tend to turn that shame and loathing inwards, by critiquing our own weight and making ourselves feel bad about our own bodies. These are the findings of a recent study by psychologists at McGill University, published in the Personality and Psychology Bulletin.
APR21	One year later, justice for my friend Loujain al-Hathloul means a full pardon from Saudi authorities	On an ordinary day almost exactly one year ago, I scrolled through my Facebook newsfeed and saw multiple posts about Loujain al-Hathloul.

APR21	People of colour are the most impacted by climate change, yet Extinction Rebellion is erasing them from the conversation	This week environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion, with the help of veteran broadcaster David Attenborough, has pushed the issue of climate change to the top of the news agenda. One section of society, however, are conspicuous by their absence, both in terms of those involved in the direct action and in the way we’re talking about the climate crisis: people of colour. Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the environmental movement. In 2015 at a climate march in London, the Wretched of the Earth bloc – made up of indigenous, black and brown people on the frontlines of climate change – was replaced by a group of people dressed in animal headgear. They were told their anti-capitalist, anti-colonial message wasn’t “positive” enough, and their demand for the recognition that communities across the global south are “the first to die, the first to fight” from climate impacts was censored.
APR21	I've been trying to help Mozambique recover from devastating floods – unless we act now, future generations are at serious risk	As the floodwaters slowly recede and cholera breaks out here in Mozambique, I recall the iconic image of the mum and her “miracle baby born in a tree” being winched from the branches above the swirling flood waters in Mozambique almost 20 years ago.  A similar story has emerged in this crisis. Baby Sara arrived in the world in the branches of a mango tree, mother Amelia also desperately clinging to her two-year-old son. It took two days for them to be rescued. They survived.
APR21	The Sri Lanka attacks are a sad reminder that the world is not free from terrorism	The bombing of churches and hotels in Sri Lanka has left a new black mark on an island which might have thought terrorism was a thing of the past. So far the death toll from the multiple attacks stands at over 200, though it seems reasonable to suppose that number will rise. Some foreign nationals are among the dead, including five Britons, but the vast majority of victims are local people. The murderous assaults were plainly well planned, and timed to coincide with Easter services. The carnage they have inflicted is unutterably grim.
APR21	Now more than ever we must all come together to support the people of Sri Lanka	The heinous attacks that targeted Christian worshippers in Sri Lanka are attacks on all of us. Easter should be a time for renewal, rebirth and redemption; a time for compassion, belonging and citizenship; a time to reflect on the lives of the wretched, the bereaved and the sick and on the selfless sacrifices of others who continue to offer a refuge for those taking treacherous journeys to flee persecution and hardships whether Muslims, Christians or others.  The scenes of solidarity and unity and people of diverse faiths donating blood to the victims are reminiscent of the scenes in the wake of the attacks on Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. They conjure up the fact that we are all humans.
APR22	The Conservative Party is already squandering the time the country does not have	“Please don’t waste this time.” That was the advice of the European Council president Donald Tusk, handed out in the small hours of the morning a week and a half ago, as he announced a six-month delay to Brexit. Don’t fritter it away like you have the past two years, was the message. Don’t keep searching for the Brexit Philosopher’s Stone, the mystical thing that might turn all the hundreds and thousands of Brexit lies into the truth, and make the impossible possible. 
APR22	Worrying about whether Fleabag is too posh to be ‘relatable’ misunderstands how comedy works	It shouldn’t be a huge surprise that, for most people, the set-up in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag makes the series largely “unrelatable” on the surface. The sense of jeopardy is dampened by the huge house belonging to the main character’s father, and her obvious wealth is at odds with the experience of most people. These are fair observations. I found it a bit grating that she is meant to be financially precarious, but manages to live alone in London. This thought though, examined in a weekend article in The Guardian, sparked a question. Fleabag was made to entertain – an objective met with delightful aplomb. So to what extent does it matter, from a pure entertainment perspective, whether a TV character’s context is wholly representative of its audience?
APR22	Passwords are a scourge for older generations and should be banished to the past	The story about passwords highlighted a major problem for silver surfers. Why do we have to have a different password for every application we use on the same device? We could of course use a login/password management tool but we have to remember what login/password to use.
APR22	Zelensky will struggle to find the funny in Ukraine’s geographical and political realities	No joke, then. No policies either. The remarkable victory of a comedian in the Ukrainian presidential election was certainly historic, though his campaign offered few clues as to what kind of a leader he will turn out to be. His slogan, after all, was “No promises. No apologies”. It worked. Volodymyr Zelensky, a comic actor who might be roughly equated to Steve Coogan or Ricky Gervais, thrashed the incumbent Petro Poroshenko by 75 per cent of the popular vote to 25 per cent. President Poroshenko, a diabetic who made his millions from confectionery, has made little progress in solving Ukraine’s fundamental problems during his five years in power. 
APR22	Celebrity fat-shaming is even more dangerous than you may think – and science proves it	Each of us has a unique relationship with fat.

APR22	As a real tribute to Stephen Lawrence let's clear the pathways that could have given him a bright future	Stephen Lawrence’s murder had a profound effect on us all, and its aftermath forced the country to go through a difficult period of reflection never before seen in the UK. When it was finally published, the Macpherson report legitimised what most of the BME community had felt and experienced for many years. In stating the view that there was “institutional racism” not just in the Met police but potentially in other public institutions too, the report was a political and societal game-changer.
APR22	Ukraine’s landslide election result delivers a twist on the new era of populism	 Volodymyr Zelensky’s landslide victory in the Ukrainian presidential elections is part of a global tide that has swept populist leaders with little or no political experience to power. Although he has refrained from making electoral promises, the image Zelensky has carefully crafted and presented before voters is that of someone eager to fight corruption and genuinely concerned with finding ways to raise the standards of living for the common folk. He has been so successful that his public persona has practically merged with this fight and this concern.
APR22	Notre Dame's restoration is a chance to make a symbolic stand against the new rise of religious hatred	In the crypt of Notre Dame cathedral, there is a commemorative plaque honouring an archbishop of Paris, Jean-Marie Lustiger. He was born into a Jewish family from Poland that emigrated to France. His mother Gisèle was deported from Orleans in 1943, to be murdered in Auschwitz. Three years before this tragedy, her young son Aaron had felt drawn to the new testament, and had converted to Catholicism during holy week. After the war, his distraught father had sought the help of Paris’ chief Rabbi to have his son Aaron Jean-Marie’s baptism annulled, but failed.
APR22	Sri Lanka's violent past has created a polarised society ripe for radicalisation	I have been travelling to Sri Lanka since 2006. The first time I visited, the Tamil Tigers carried out a suicide attack just a couple of blocks from where I was staying. It seemed that the war between the Tamil militants and the Sri Lankan government would never end. But it did: in 2009 the government launched a brutal attack that ended the war.  Even though the end came in a very cruel way, with the deaths of many civilians, I thought that maybe now the healing could start between the different communities in the country. I was wrong.
APR23	The only thing Change UK wants to change is the people	It is not yet 24 hours since I last began a column about Brexit by repeating Donald Tusk’s now two-week-old warning to Britain, to “please, not waste” the extra time we had to ask for and were given. And it is, I fear, unlikely to be a further 24 before I have done so for a third time. But what choice do they give us, at the end of a day in which the time we do not have has mainly been put to use by a small handful of former Tory and Labour MPs getting together with a few big fish from the very small pond that is the Remain Twitter universe, to dress up as – but definitely not join – the Lib Dems? 
APR23	Muslim female NHS workers are being bullied over outdated uniform rules. Why haven’t trusts taken action?	A recent study has suggested that some Muslim female healthcare professionals experience bullying and harassment in the workplace over covering their heads and forearms in surgery. As a doctor who has worked in the NHS for over 15 years, it’s both saddening and surprising that a service which prides itself on diverse “compassionate” leadership, is failing to live up to that promise. Although the original 2007 guidance published by the Department of Health on uniforms and workwear became known as the “bare below the elbows guidance”, made famous in 2011 when a surgeon interrupted David Cameron’s hospital visit by asking him to roll up his sleeves, it is important to note that the guidance is actually about ensuring hand hygiene.
APR23	Trump’s state visit may stick in the craw but he should be permitted to address parliament in June	The promise of a full state visit to Britain by President Trump has been a thorny issue ever since Theresa May extended a rather fawning invitation on her own trip to the White House in January 2017. Such was the outpouring of criticism over the prime minister’s hasty act – and of Mr Trump’s presidency – that for a considerable time it appeared unlikely that such a visit would actually come to pass.
APR23	Labour could destroy the Brexit Party and Tories in the European elections – but only if it backs Remain	Has a small political miracle taken place? For the first time since the Brexit vote, Labour has been able to show a coherent, confident profile on Europe in place of the confused contradictory circumlocutions associated with the Corbyn shadow cabinet’s appearances on the BBC, and in other media. The list of candidates in winnable positions on Labour’s list of would-be MEPs for the European parliament elections is the most progressive slate of serious candidates ever put forward by a British political party since the first direct elections to the European parliament 40 years ago.
APR23	Greek politicians’ cynical blame game over reparations for Nazi war crimes isn’t really about WWII	Nearly three-quarters of a century on from the end of the Second World War, the issue of reparations has reared its head again, with Greek members of parliament having voted in favour of seeking new payments from Germany. At present, no figure has been set by the Greek government, although a parliamentary enquiry in 2016 argued that the cost of the Nazi occupation between 1941 and 1944 was more than €300bn.
APR23	Passwords are a scourge for older generations and should be banished to the past	The story about passwords highlighted a major problem for silver surfers. Why do we have to have a different password for every application we use on the same device? We could of course use a login/password management tool but we have to remember what login/password to use.
APR23	Race-baiting Boris should be nowhere near No 10 – and the New York Yankees have shown us why	What links Boris Johnson to Kate Smith, America’s “songbird of the south” who served a similar role to the one Dame Vera Lynn played in this country during the Second World War, and sang some of the same songs too? If you answered “the use of crude, racist language”, quick, fill in an entry form for the next season of the BBC’s Only Connect. Victoria Coren Mitchell wants you! 
APR23	India is set to take the UK's place as the world’s fifth largest economy – but is it really all down to Modi?	The elections of the world’s greatest democracy carried on today, with Narendra Modi casting his own vote. His pitch for a second five-year term of office as prime minister, has been the strength of the economy – pushing India into becoming the world’s fastest-growing large country, faster even that China. This year India is also set to become the world’s fifth largest economy, passing the UK, and behind only the US, China, Japan and Germany. It is an extraordinary achievement, but one that raises many questions. Is this growth sustainable? Is it delivering benefits to the whole population, or just the elite? Will it continue?
APR23	The tide is turning for Change UK thanks to the EU elections. But will sheer novelty keep it afloat?	Change UK, formerly the Independent Group, is enjoying exceptionally good luck. Only a few weeks ago it seemed possible that a general election might be called in which the group would, in all probability, be wiped out. Without much in the way of grassroots organisation, and with a limited degree of public recognition, it was always vulnerable to a snap general that would catch it unprepared – without even a new party name to campaign under, let alone an army of canvassers to call upon. Under first past the post, only a few of its number would have survived an onslaught by their former parties.
APR23	Dear Boris Johnson, it's not Extinction Rebellion who are 'smug, irritating and disruptive'	I am fed up with Boris Johnson’s constant disruption and his assumption that his opinion is more important than my own. I find him “smug, irritating and disruptive”. He is also deeply uneducated on the matter of climate change and the causes of it. The only things that distinguish him from the portrait of the people that he lambasts in his article in The Telegraph, is a shred of decency, constancy oh... and the double-barrelled name. Laura DawsonHarpenden
APR24	From Ann Widdecombe to Sargon of Akkad, the EU elections are starting to look like a dinner party from hell	There’s an old saying that a country gets the politicians it deserves. If so, then I wonder about the Change UK candidates having to resign after a matter of hours on the party slate due to various past misdeeds and mistweets. This, after all, is supposed to be the group that will fix our “broken politics”, but which seems to have quite a few broken reputations of its own littering the scene. Indeed, the candidates for the European parliament generally have an eccentric air to them. I also ask myself what the good people of the southwest of England (plus Gibraltar) have done to deserve the most, shall we say, diverse group of candidates ever assembled for a democratic election.
APR24	Five years ago Tory panic pushed Nigel Farage to victory in Europe – now they’re rolling out the red carpet again	Politics is going round in circles. Five years ago, Nigel Farage emerged triumphant from the European parliament elections, after Ukip won the most votes and seats. David Cameron, spooked by Ukip’s threat with a general election looming, had already announced an in/out referendum on EU membership. But the 2016 referendum verdict has been undeliverable, and now history is repeating itself.
APR24	Theresa May’s decision to let Huawei build the UK’s 5G network is yet more proof of her incompetence	I note with some incredulity that Theresa May has decided to award the contract to build the UK’s 5G network to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, despite the very serious security concerns expressed by pretty much everybody. Are we to presume that this is her idea of a “global Britain” free to strike deals with the rest of the world? It looks as though, after months of having to deal with rogue and extremist elements in her ranks, the pressure has finally got to her. Never mind no-confidence votes, her party may want to consider retiring the prime minister for the sake of her own mental health.
APR24	A steady rise in food bank use is a stark reminder that universal credit has been an abject failure	Hunger stalks too many British families. There is plenty of statistical and anecdotal evidence for this, and it is something that has not been seen widely in society since before the Second World War. Not the least of the indicators of a persistent national scandal is the number of parcels doled out by food banks – British citizens being sustained in life and health by charity, in other words. Indeed, the situation is deteriorating. The Trussell Trust, which runs one of the largest networks of food banks, says that the 12 months to March 2019 was the busiest for them since they opened in 1997. Some 1.6 million food packages were distributed last year, up about a fifth on the previous 12 months, and up 73 per cent over two years.
APR24	Trump’s state visit may stick in the craw but he should be permitted to address parliament in June	The promise of a full state visit to Britain by President Trump has been a thorny issue ever since Theresa May extended a rather fawning invitation on her own trip to the White House in January 2017.

APR24	Saudi Arabia executed 37 people and all the UK did was shrug. What will it take for the west to speak up?	 It was little over a year ago that the Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, made a high-profile visit to London. During his three-day stay he was treated to lunch with the Queen, dinner with Princes William and Charles, and photos on the steps of Downing Street.
APR24	Dear Boris Johnson, using your gigantic platform to moan about kids like me won’t stop us fighting climate change	Look, I can understand people’s frustration at transport being stopped by climate change protestors, in a city where traffic is never kind. I get how irritating it must be that buses that are rarely on time have now been delayed even further. But I don’t understand why, instead of taking notice of this cause, Boris Johnson still insists on reducing Extinction Rebellion’s groundbreaking efforts to a mere annoyance that “slightly grinds his teeth”.  
APR24	Since I announced my Change UK candidacy I’ve been accused of Islamophobia – it’s nothing short of a smear campaign	Ever since the announcement yesterday of my candidacy as a London MEP for Change UK – The Independent Group, I have been subjected to an online campaign of false allegations of racism, including an accusation by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) that I am Islamophobic. I have never – not once – expressed anti-Muslim hatred or bigotry. I have always been clear that any criticisms I may make are about Islamism, and conservative Islamic cultures or beliefs; never Muslims. I am horrified, appalled and deeply upset to have been targeted by what appears to be an active campaign of smears and lies from hard-left activists and the MCB.
APR24	Britain is ready to gamble on China's Huawei – it makes sense financially, but is a grave moral misjudgement	The National Security Council, chaired by the prime minister, has agreed to allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to play a part in the construction of Britain’s 5G network. A formal decision will be announced in due course but it seems unlikely anything will change unless the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport includes particularly damning findings in its own review. The reassurance has come that Huawei will be included in only “non-core” parts of the network, but still, the decision has raised eyebrows both in London and among some of the UK’s closest allies. It also contradicts US warnings about dealings with Huawei even if such warnings have lost a degree of credibility under the presidency of Donald Trump. 
APR25	The reaction to Joe Biden running for president tells you everything you need to know	The ancient Democratic Party obelisk known as Joe Biden announced his intention to run for president today, and it wasn’t hard to tell that the burgeoning new American left views him as a serious threat. Sure, squeaky-clean neophytes like Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg might garner single- or even double-digits from early primary states like Iowa, and the Bernie supporters of Twitter might get a lot of traction out of mocking them. 
APR25	No, Elizabeth Warren's college debt plan isn't 'a slap in the face' to people like me who wouldn't personally benefit	Earlier this week, US Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren announced a policy plan that would wipe out most college debt in the US. Specifically, her plans would eliminate at least a portion of up to 95 per cent of American student loan-holders’ debt — and create universal free college by establishing a two per cent wealth tax on the richest Americans. It didn't take long for some people who had already paid off their loans to cry, “No fair!” 
APR25	A steady rise in food bank use is a stark reminder that universal credit has been an abject failure	Hunger stalks too many British families. There is plenty of statistical and anecdotal evidence for this, and it is something that has not been seen widely in society since before the Second World War. Not the least of the indicators of a persistent national scandal is the number of parcels doled out by food banks – British citizens being sustained in life and health by charity, in other words. Indeed, the situation is deteriorating. The Trussell Trust, which runs one of the largest networks of food banks, says that the 12 months to March 2019 was the busiest for them since they opened in 1997. Some 1.6 million food packages were distributed last year, up about a fifth on the previous 12 months, and up 73 per cent over two years.
APR25	Wearing a genuine skin-tone plaster can feel like a revolutionary act for people of colour	A simple tweet by Dominique Apollon – a campaigner for racial justice – showing his finger covered with a brown plaster highlighted what people of colour already know: few products are made with us in mind.  The picture showed Dominique wearing a plaster designed for those with darker skin that perfectly camouflaged against his own brown skin. The image brought him to tears – likely a feeling of relief – which many with darker skin can relate to. 
APR25	Trump’s state visit may stick in the craw but he should be permitted to address parliament in June	The promise of a full state visit to Britain by President Trump has been a thorny issue ever since Theresa May extended a rather fawning invitation on her own trip to the White House in January 2017. Such was the outpouring of criticism over the prime minister’s hasty act – and of Mr Trump’s presidency – that for a considerable time it appeared unlikely that such a visit would actually come to pass.
APR25	Zelensky will struggle to find the funny in Ukraine’s geographical and political realities	No joke, then. No policies either. The remarkable victory of a comedian in the Ukrainian presidential election was certainly historic, though his campaign offered few clues as to what kind of a leader he will turn out to be. His slogan, after all, was “No promises. No apologies”. It worked. Volodymyr Zelensky, a comic actor who might be roughly equated to Steve Coogan or Ricky Gervais, thrashed the incumbent Petro Poroshenko by 75 per cent of the popular vote to 25 per cent. President Poroshenko, a diabetic who made his millions from confectionery, has made little progress in solving Ukraine’s fundamental problems during his five years in power. 
APR25	Nicola Sturgeon has handed Theresa May a lifeline with her call for a new referendum on Scottish independence	Nicola Sturgeon has announced plans to hold a new referendum on Scottish independence. The first minister told the Scottish parliament she will soon introduce legislation to prepare for another vote by 2021 if Scotland is taken out of the EU. I write this just a stone’s throw away from Holyrood and a short walk from the Edinburgh polling place where I voted in 2014’s historic independence referendum. But now, five years on, everything has changed – or so Sturgeon wants us to believe.
APR25	The Shakespeare cult has steamrollered past better writers in our schools – and he’s not even that good	There are a few things that you are just not allowed to dislike. The Beatles, for instance. David Attenborough programmes. And as I found out today, Shakespeare. But the thing is, I don’t like Shakespeare, and I especially disliked studying it. Which is why I agree with Hilary Mantel that Shakespeare shouldn’t be an exam topic on the UK school syllabus.
APR25	The UK's new MEPs will be so terrible, the EU will give us anything at all just to get rid of them	Could it be, could it actually be, that we had a Brexit masterplan all along, and at the impossible hour, it’s going to come good? Consider this: the UK has never known what it wants from Brexit other than whatever it wants has to be something it can’t have. First up, to demand the impossible, we sent them David Davis. They laughed and sent him back. Then we sent them Dominic Raab. Dominic got as far as the White Cliffs of Dover before making a mindblowing geographical discovery and everyone laughed so hard that nothing else could be heard. Then we sent them Stephen Barclay and they said, “Sorry, feel free to start the meter but I’m going to be a couple more hours yet.”
APR25	Joe Biden has finally declared – but whether he’s the man to take on Trump remains to be seen	After a prolonged period in which he mercilessly teased his party, the media and American voters about his intentions, Joe Biden has finally declared his candidature for the presidency. It was hardly unexpected, having previously let slip his plans in the past. He has, in fact, run for the presidency, with varying degrees of seriousness, three times before. He is a respected former vice president under Barack Obama, and one of the most experienced players at the top of American politics – including a 36-year stint as a senator for Delaware. British observers with long memories will recall his plagiarism of a Neil Kinnock speech back in 1987: “Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?”
APR26	The facts tell us Joe Biden is the best choice for Democrats in 2020. So why is he being attacked by his own?	Joe Biden was beloved by Democrats when he was vice-president. When he chose not to run in 2016 and Donald Trump won, many Democrats said Biden likely would have beaten the Republican candidate, prevailing in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — the three states that ultimately delivered Trump's electoral victory.  Now that Biden is in for 2020, the tables have suddenly turned. Before Biden even got into the race, he faced a backlash from progressive activists over what was called inappropriate touching. No one accused Biden of sexual harassment, but several women did claim Biden invaded their space in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. Biden also faced scrutiny for his vote on the 1994 crime bill, his views on busing and the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings. 
APR26	This is what you were supposed to hear at the White House Correspondents' Dinner — before they decided against a comedian	Tomorrow night is the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner - and President Trump won’t be in attendance again. This year he’s instructed his cabinet not to attend the dinner either.  For some, compliance with this request was easier than others. Mike Pence was never going to attend as it would set his oestrogen radar off. Sarah Sanders told the President she’d skip the dinner but will show up anyway. I guess she lied.
APR26	Extinction Rebellion’s call for urgent climate action is a critical juncture for the future of humanity	As a group of citizens, academics, educators and professional staff working in countries being profoundly damaged by climate breakdown we applaud the peaceful, creative and inclusive displays of determined protest and civil disobedience by Extinction Rebellion activists worldwide, in calling governments and big business to take urgent and radical action.   Without action, we will fail to control devastating temperature rises. Without action, we will continue to witness flooding, crop failure and the collapse of biodiversity. It is always the poorest and most marginalised that suffer the worst consequences, exacerbated by poor governance, social conflict and displacement. Without action, our work to eradicate poverty and achieve inclusive and genuinely sustainable development that leaves no one behind will be in vain.  
APR26	Mea Culpa: That fine mess we’ve gotten into, again	We reported the findings of a survey of teachers that found many of them paid for classroom essentials out of their own money, and wrote that one said “they had gotten themselves into debt because of these purchases”.  I have written about “gotten” before (a few times). I like it. It is a good English word that died out over here after we exported it to America – except in the fossilised form, “ill-gotten gains”. It featured in my “Top 10 Americanisms that were originally English”, along with fall, trash and faucet. 
APR26	Fellow dog owners, it’s time to accept that people aren’t obligated to love our pets	One of the marvellous things about being from two countries, with two languages and two very different cultures, is that I can step out of each now and then, and peep in with the warm familiarity of an insider and the bafflement of a visitor. It’s like having one eye that’s English and another that’s Iranian, and I gain a little depth perception by looking through both at once. In Iran, there is a saying: “An unexpected guest is a gift from god.” This beautiful expression sums up the incredible warmth and hospitality of the Iranians I know and love. Throughout my childhood, my mother could frequently be found dashing about in the kitchen, hurriedly preparing an impromptu banquet because my father had just met a nice couple washing their car outside and invited them in for lunch.
APR26	No, Elizabeth Warren's college debt plan isn't 'a slap in the face' to people like me who wouldn't personally benefit	Earlier this week, US Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren announced a policy plan that would wipe out most college debt in the US. Specifically, her plans would eliminate at least a portion of up to 95 per cent of American student loan-holders’ debt — and create universal free college by establishing a two per cent wealth tax on the richest Americans. It didn't take long for some people who had already paid off their loans to cry, “No fair!” 
APR26	When Donald Trump defended his remarks about Charlottesville today, this is what I thought	After 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden re-upped President Donald J Trump’s reaction to Charlottesville in his campaign announcement,  Trump doubled down on his previous comments about “good people on both sides” today. Given the chance to renounce what he’d said — or claim he used unwise words in the moment — he instead said at a press conference on the White House lawn that “if you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly.” At Charlottesville, where a Unite the Right rally ended in the death of peaceful protester Heather Heyer after a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd deliberately, the hoods were off. No identities were hidden. Everything was out in the open for anyone and everyone to see. 
APR26	Muslim Americans are plugging the gaps in America's healthcare system. After our friend was killed, we knew we had to tell people	On 26 May 2017, our friend Taliesin Namkai Meche, 23, was stabbed to death on a commuter train in Portland, Oregon. Taliesin had intervened to stop the harassment of two young women of color, one of whom was described as “visibly Muslim”. A few moments later, he gave up his life to protect them. We flew to Portland for Taliesin’s memorial service in a state of shock. Reunited under these circumstances, the two of us grappled with how to honor his sacrifice.
APR26	Peace in Northern Ireland now feels more fragile than ever – but Brexit risks losing it altogether	It took the murder of a journalist, Lyra McKee, and the public shaming of the political classes at her funeral to re-establish even the most tentative dialogue about securing peace in Northern Ireland. It should not have been this way, and it is a grim indictment of politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea that the political institutions that delivered peace were so badly neglected for so long. For the disturbances in the Creggan, in which McKee lost her life to a gunman, the recent letter bomb campaign and other thwarted terror plots serve as a warning that a new generation of hardline Republican men of violence are ready and willing to resume the Troubles. Some were not even born when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, with the firsthand memories of three decades of murder and mayhem fading for a younger generation. 
APR26	Vote for the Liberal Democrats and help us to stop Brexit in its tracks	Today, I launched the Liberal Democrats’ European election campaign with one simple message: a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit. The fact European elections are happening at all is testament to the dismal failure of Brexiteers to have any common plan about what Brexit should mean. What we know is that Brexit of any kind puts our country at risk – the NHS, our public services, jobs across the country and peace in Northern Ireland. 
APR27	Trump’s UK state banquet is designed to distract from his failures – Corbyn is right to shun the circus	Sure, turning down an invite to a banquet for Donald Trump is little more than gesture politics. But throwing a banquet for Donald Trump is gesture politics on a grand scale to begin with, and of the two, I know which gesture I prefer. Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to stay in and wash his hair that night, perhaps opting for a modest takeaway falafel wrap in preference to the multiple courses of haute cuisine dished up on these occasions, has inevitably brought huge quantities of incoming flak. The most histrionic denunciations gleefully list the “dictators, despots and despicable groups” with whom the he previously has chowed down.
APR27	I was given a council house when a landlord kicked us out – today’s working class aren’t so lucky	I grew up in Portsmouth and lived in private rentals with my single mum and my brother until I was 11, until we were evicted at short notice by our landlord and re-housed in a council flat by the local authority. We were quite lucky, even though it didn’t feel like it to me at the time. Nowadays families often end up in emergency accommodation, such as hostels and B&Bs, before getting housed, but I still remember the lump in my throat as we drove up to the monolithic tower and it sunk in that I’d be living on an estate in Somerstown; the sort of place my mum had warned me not to walk through on my own.
APR27	Should neo-Nazis be banned or just kept under surveillance?	The Independent has been an uncompromising defender of free speech since its foundation. We believe that the best way to fight bad ideas is with better ideas. We are biased against banning things, and in particular against banning the expression of opinions.  Our prejudice is that organisations advocating views that most people find abhorrent should not be banned. We would rather that their views be held up to public view and challenged. There is, of course, a difference between expressing obnoxious views and inciting, soliciting or organising violence. Which is why we supported the decision in 2016 to ban National Action, the British neo-Nazi group.
APR27	The Top 10: Pompous Phrases	Richard Coles, the Communard turned vicar, asked if anyone ever used the phrase, “I am minded to…”, without sounding ridiculous. Graham Sutton suggested I should compile the worst examples. “I think I speak on behalf of all of us when I say that is a very good idea,” said David Mills.  A popular subject this week, so it is actually a Top 20. 
APR27	Trump is about to nominate Kentucky socialite Kelly Knight Craft as UN ambassador — say goodbye to sensible diplomacy	When Trump officially nominates Kentucky socialite Kelly Knight Craft as ambassador to the United Nations next week, the US will have officially killed off any semblance of making efforts toward international diplomacy.  Knight Craft has been the US Ambassador to Canada since 2017, but the veneer of preparation for the UN post is quite thin. She is a monied socialite and billionaire donor to the Republican party with ties to Kentucky's high society. Wife to a major US coal producer, she has said she “respects both sides of the climate change science”. 
APR27	This is what you were supposed to hear at the White House Correspondents' Dinner — before they decided against a comedian	Tomorrow night is the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner - and President Trump won’t be in attendance again. This year he’s instructed his cabinet not to attend the dinner either.  For some, compliance with this request was easier than others. Mike Pence was never going to attend as it would set his oestrogen radar off. Sarah Sanders told the President she’d skip the dinner but will show up anyway. I guess she lied.
APR27	How Meghan’s royal baby could become an American – and secure the special relationship for good	The news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their first child this year was greeted warmly by the world’s media. The couple give the monarchy a new face and fresh approach, and the royal birth an opportunity to improve the “special relationship”. The newest member of the House of Windsor can claim dual nationality from both the UK and USA when born in a royal first. While he or she would be British through Prince Harry, the child could become an American citizen through his or her mother. This is where things can get interesting.
APR27	British governments are making it cheaper to fly – and the environmental damage will be immense	After months of Brexit obsession, David Attenborough, Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg’s youthful crew have drawn the nation’s attention back to the bigger issue of climate change. Governments across the British Isles have been keen to act concerned about the climate. Yet in reality, they are overseeing a race to the bottom which is making the most environmentally damaging form of transport cheaper and cheaper.
APR27	The Remain parties must unite in the European elections – otherwise the Brexit Party will prevail	I agree with everything Vince Cable has to say, with one exception. The focus on voting for a Remain party rather than a Remain ticket is more than just pedantry. Our electoral system means that votes are allocated to party lists, running the huge risk of splitting the Remain vote and paving the way for a Brexit majority to prevail.
APR27	Isis has fallen to pieces in Syria – but the country’s subjugated women remain defiant	After years of fighting, the Syrian Democratic Forces have declared final victory over Isis. This victory is a gift and provides hope, not least for those who suffered under their cruelty. But as we celebrate the defeat of Isis we must not forget the sacrifice of women as the battle for Syria continues. In the midst of the horrors, many women have emerged who can act as an inspiration for us all, be it the remarkable young women who have taken a leading role in the opposition to Assad and Isis, the women tortured and murdered in Assad’s prisons or the Yazidis enslaved and raped by Isis.
APR28	The Sri Lanka attacks show how Isis is moving east to recruit members	Attacks on Sri Lankan churches during Easter celebrations rocked the news last week. Churches were desecrated and reduced to rubble. The pictures of agonising worshippers bled across media platforms. Residents across the country were shocked and terrified by reports and internet communications were limited. Intelligence officials found possible links between suspected attackers and a Sri Lankan group who pledged their allegiance to the Islamic State. Isis’s own media reports revealed it claimed responsibility for the attacks. While the group lost its “caliphate” territory in Iraq and Syria last month, there are still fighters scattered globally looking for retaliation, mostly in the east. The group also claimed attacks in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan on the same day.
APR28	Joe Biden may not be who we want, but he's what we need to beat Trump	Joe Biden has announced that he is running for president, but it’s too early to fret about his campaign anthem. When that time comes, he could do worse than “You Can’t Get Always Get What You Want”. The Stones’ classic would be a boldly self-aware choice, brazenly acknowledging that to many Democrats he is exactly what they don’t want. In a field overflowing with thrilling prospects – a forensically dazzling woman of colour in Kamala Harris; the promise and novelty of the young and gay Pete Buttigieg; the sex-on-legs charisma of Beto O’Rourke; the socialist (by US standards) tub-thumping of Bernie Sanders – the 76-year-old Biden, whom Donald Trump has taken to calling Sleepy Joe, seems a wretched fit for the woke generation.

APR28	I hate summer and from now on refuse to apologise for it. Who’s with me?	I’m sorry to say this, but if you have ever invited me to a barbecue on a hot day between the months of May and September, I probably hated it. I have loathed almost every barbecue I’ve attended. Any visit to the beach in high summer has been an exercise in extreme discomfort, and to invite me to a picnic when it’s “T-shirt weather” is to watch me sweat and labour my way through it, as though I’m enduring actual physical torture – and not what basically amounts to the al fresco consumption of a communal tube of Pringles.
APR28	A steady rise in food bank use is a stark reminder that universal credit has been an abject failure	Hunger stalks too many British families. There is plenty of statistical and anecdotal evidence for this, and it is something that has not been seen widely in society since before the Second World War. Not the least of the indicators of a persistent national scandal is the number of parcels doled out by food banks – British citizens being sustained in life and health by charity, in other words. Indeed, the situation is deteriorating. The Trussell Trust, which runs one of the largest networks of food banks, says that the 12 months to March 2019 was the busiest for them since they opened in 1997. Some 1.6 million food packages were distributed last year, up about a fifth on the previous 12 months, and up 73 per cent over two years.
APR28	After Huawei, the west can’t pull up a drawbridge against China – we stand to lose more	The Chinese ambassador has urged the UK to make an independent judgement on the security aspects of Huawei telecom equipment. There are certainly national security issues here, as my colleague Kim Sengupta argues. But there is also the wider economic dimension, not just for the UK but for all advanced economies. To what extent will China’s growing economic weight in the world mean that we cannot ignore the activities of its major corporations? You can look at this in big global terms. In about 10 years’ time China will pass the US to become the world’s largest economy, and that will be a seismic event. A huge amount of thought, debate and indeed anguish will be associated with that. Rather less thought has gone into what this will mean in detail. It is true that any western company with global ambitions will have a China strategy, but we mostly still think of it as an emerging market that just happens to have become a very big one.
APR28	Why Trump will win in 2020 and it won't even be close	The 2020 election isn’t going to be close. The first-quarter gross domestic product growth rate of 3.2 per cent sets up the first reality that will be noted in November 2020 because it telegraphs where the economy will be then: not in recession.
APR28	The public have their foot on the government’s neck over climate change – now it has no choice but to listen	Jeremy Corbyn, long a campaigner for seemingly hopeless causes, might be expected to have more sympathy than most for the Extinction Rebellion protesters. Even though he apparently displayed some indifference to the handful who glued themselves to a fence outside his home, he has taken the cue and called on the government to announce a climate change emergency.
APR28	Global inequality is 25% higher than it would have been in a climate-stable world	Those least responsible for global warming will suffer the most. Poorer countries – those that have contributed far less to climate change – tend to be situated in warmer regions, where additional warming causes the most devastation. Extreme weather events such as Syria’s prolonged drought, South Asia’s catastrophic monsoon floods, and Cyclone Idai in South-East Africa, the third deadliest cyclone on record, are becoming more likely and more severe. These events are disproportionately bringing death, displacement, and crop failure. As a result of this, projections estimate that the economies of poorer, warmer countries will be gravely harmed by climate change over coming decades, while the cooler, richer countries responsible for the vast majority of the extra CO2 in the air may even benefit in the short term. But as new research reveals, this is not just a future concern – the economic injustice of climate change has already been operating for 60 years.
APR29	Yes, I want universal healthcare in America — but not through Medicare-for-all	In America, both Democrats and Republicans can agree on one thing about our healthcare system: it isn’t working. Out of all developed countries, the United States spends the most on healthcare per capita — even countries like the UK which have a free national healthcare system. Yet there are still 28.5 million people that are uninsured and unable to get basic treatment. The lack of a cohesive health strategy may well have cost Republicans the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and there can be little doubt that healthcare reform for all Americans will be a primary focus of the 2020 presidential election.
APR29	Don't ask me about the perpetrator of the Poway synagogue shooting. Ask me about Lori Gilbert Kaye	Lori Gilbert Kaye, Lori Gilbert Kaye, Lori Gilbert Kaye, Lori Gilbert Kaye. If you haven’t yet heard this name, please familiarize yourself with it.   While a large portion of America has memorized the name of a 19-year-old shooter who entered the Chabad of Poway in San Diego County this past weekend, armed with an AR-15, very few can name the woman who lost her life in that same synagogue.

APR29	If Labour’s Rebecca Long-Bailey really wanted to be a voice for UK businesses, she’d stop trying to push Brexit through	Streatham is home to Europe’s longest continuous high road where you will find over 500 diverse, local businesses. Retail has a long history in these parts with the UK’s first supermarket – Express Dairies Premier Supermarket – being opened on our main thoroughfare in 1951. In 2013, I led a campaign, along with others, to establish our first Business Improvement District, InStreatham, which is the voice of those businesses and we held a high street summit last Friday.
APR29	Sri Lanka’s face cover ban has nothing to do with protecting citizens – its only goal is to punish Muslim women	One week after the Easter Sunday attacks, Sri Lanka is still in turmoil. As law enforcement and security forces proceed with investigations, and searches throughout the island have uncovered more weapons, fear, confusion and misinformation are rife. It wasn’t long before Islamophobes called for a burqa and niqab ban, and the government wasted no time in issuing a statement declaring a ban on “all face coverings” soon after, though their intended target is clearly the niqab and burqa worn by some Muslim women.
APR29	Reports of the Conservative Party’s tragic demise are greatly exaggerated	Twenty years ago, not altogether long after Blair’s landslide election victory, and with William Hague driving around the country in a rather mad “Keep the Pound” white van, I happened to go on a school sixth form trip to be in the audience on the BBC’s Question Time. I can clearly recall, verbatim, the first question put to the panel. “Is the Tory Party self-destructing, and should we be lamenting its passing?”
APR29	I saw China break agreements with the UK government when I lived there. Let’s not fall for Huawei’s assurances now	As part of the pullout arrangements in 1997, Beijing agreed with the UK to a 50-year period of non-interference in the affairs of Hong Kong. Unenforceable in practice, this arrangement was based largely on trust. As a long-term resident of China from 2000 onwards, I was personally witness to systemic breaches of those conditions on both sides of the border. From kidnappings of Hong Kong booksellers, kangaroo courts, visa denial and the crushing of democracy in the special administrative regions, Beijing’s acts of bad faith are numerous, well publicised and need no further autopsy. Our government now seems happy to again trust China in the form of Huawei, a company with genesis in the army – and by extension, an arm of the Chinese state apparatus – to roll out a 5G network here, potentially compromising British national security. Yet May and Co assure us that sensitive data is immune to any external threat, despite importing foreign expertise to set this up, because the Chinese are ahead of us on telecoms. What am I missing?
APR30	Elizabeth Warren is the Barack Obama of 2020. So why is she polling so badly?	When voters look at Elizabeth Warren, it’s hard to see what’s not to like. She looks professional, yet approachable. She speaks clearly and intelligently while using stories and everyday language to address her audiences and each of them —from Mississippi to New Hampshire to Iowa — loves her. She has detailed plans for everything. Her campaign slogan could easily be “Yes We Can — I’ve Got A Plan,” and that’s not just a convenient rhyme; she reminds me very much of Barack Obama, specifically during his 2008 run.  Both Obama and Warren believe in ending political corruption, strengthening the American healthcare system and economy, restructuring the tax system to unburden the average citizen, eliminating bigotry, and ending the cycle of foreign wars. Obama’s potential constituents were most concerned about the economy, healthcare, education, energy, and Iraq. Today’s liberal voters feel similarly (substituting Syria for Iraq). And they both believe in raising their own campaign funds, though Warren rejects the PAC dollars that Obama didn’t. 
APR30	Rod Rosenstein resigned and thanked Trump for his ‘courtesy’. Is this the saddest ever case of Stockholm syndrome?	Rod Rosenstein, the latest broken soul to join the exodus from the Trump house of torture, saved his best until last. Admittedly, that isn’t the highest of bars to clear. For almost two years, the soon-to-be ex-deputy attorney general of the US covered himself in whatever the polar opposite of glory might be.
APR30	Why I had the gender on my birth certificate changed to non-binary	What would you consider to be the most important aspect of your identity? For some, it's their heritage or religion. For others, it can be their career, hobby or whichever fandoms they belong to. For the record, I’m black American, I’m a theist with no religious affiliation, I’m a writer, I enjoy DC comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I stan Janet Jackson like no other. But however you define yourself, it's usually informed by your gender. Gender impacts how we see the world and how the world in turn treats us. If you asked me “Are you a man or a woman?” I could take a few days to answer that question because the answer isn’t either/or. People look at me and assume I’m a man. I’m not. I was assigned male at birth, yes, but I define myself as a woman. Moreover, gender has always been more of a complicated question for me. For cisgender individuals, manhood and womanhood are pretty straightforward. However, for transgender and intersex people who experience a discontinuity between their sex assignment, anatomy and sense of self, being asked to define one’s gender can lead to an existential crisis.
APR30	Cambridge University’s investigation into its role in the slave trade is pointless. What about modern slavery?	Cambridge University is an easy public target for an investigation into its links to the slave trade, but of no value unless all “beneficiaries” are examined concurrently and fairly.   A balanced approach would be to look at everyone who came to prominence during the slave trade and whose legacy wealth is from that time: every port merchant, every old rich family (ennobled or not), every old stock exchange portfolio, every charity, every building, every inheritance and so it goes on.  
APR30	When I reported my rape, the police asked for my Facebook login. Why should I be under more scrutiny than my attacker?	At the age of 15, I was raped by an 18-year-old I’d met online. Although I tried to downplay the severity of what happened and blamed myself for agreeing to go to the house of someone I’d only just met, over time the memories gradually ate away at me. It was only when I googled my rapist’s name in February 2018 and discovered that he was in prison for committing another crime involving an underage girl that I found the courage to contact the police. I have a lot of praise for the officers involved with my case. From the moment I picked up the phone to the day they informed me there wasn’t enough evidence to take my rapist to court, I felt respected and believed. However, there were elements of the investigation that made me feel uneasy, such as the day I was asked me to share my Facebook login details.
APR30	Yes, I want universal healthcare in America — but not through Medicare-for-all	In America, both Democrats and Republicans can agree on one thing about our healthcare system: it isn’t working. Out of all developed countries, the United States spends the most on healthcare per capita — even countries like the UK which have a free national healthcare system. Yet there are still 28.5 million people that are uninsured and unable to get basic treatment. The lack of a cohesive health strategy may well have cost Republicans the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and there can be little doubt that healthcare reform for all Americans will be a primary focus of the 2020 presidential election.
APR30	Though Isis leader al-Baghdadi is alive, this poor strategist may not be a huge threat	The reappearance of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has the same shock effect as that of Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of 9/11. It has all the greater impact because of claims that, with the elimination of the last territory held by Isis in March this year, that group was close to being out of business as a serious threat. The slaughter of some 250 civilians in Sri Lanka had already showed that Isis retains its ability to take control of the international news agenda with suicide bombing attacks directed at civilians. “As for our brothers in Sri Lanka, I was overjoyed when I heard about the suicide attack, which overthrew the cradles of the Crusaders, and avenged them for our brethren in Baghouz,” al-Baghdadi said.
APR30	Labour's Brexit policy is as deliberately clear as the rules of Mornington Crescent	There are, potentially, reasons that Leon Trotsky came up with a thing called “entryism”, and chose to leave “exitism” uninvented, at least until now. Entryism is the kind of thing that can allow a curious cabal of hard-left weirdos to transform one of Britain’s two major political parties into a Jew-hating troll farm with personality cult attached, and still look like winning the next general election.
APR30	Corbyn’s taste for Brexit fudge leaves us facing a national trauma that only a Final Say referendum can remedy	Whether he “stormed out” of the shadow cabinet meeting or rather took his leave politely and just nipped out to try and discover what Labour’s latest policy on Brexit is, Tom Watson’s frustration with his party’s attitude has long been more than apparent. He may express himself in sotto voce tones and measured terms, but Mr Watson ill-concealed irritation is justified: Labour is in a mess about Brexit.  The national executive committee’s latest policy proposal is a familiar reworking of its usual fudge, and it is not good enough. Labour is betraying its own people, and the wider electorate, by failing to back a Final Say referendum on whatever the terms of Brexit turn out to be. It is quite something from a party that purports to be both democratic and socialist to want to betray the people and, in particular, working people and the most vulnerable in society – those who will suffer most from any form of Brexit.
APR30	People want a single body to run our railways again. Perhaps we should call it British Rail?	Even in the lull between closures over Easter and the early May bank holiday, rail travel at London Euston has not exactly been problem free.  Serco, which runs the overnight Caledonian Sleeper between the English capital and dozens of stations in Scotland, chose Sunday night to launch its new £100m rolling stock. A series of Network Rail issues from Carstairs to Wembley meant that the overnight “express” from Edinburgh to London achieved a sedate average speed of 32mph. Many passengers arrived at their destination over three hours late, with the contingent bound for Fort William reaching the town only in the early afternoon of Monday. 
MAY1	Any shred of credibility William Barr still had after the Mueller report was destroyed today during his hearing	Special Counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report revealed the scope of Russia's attacks on US democracy and unprecedented corruption on the part of President Trump and his 2016 campaign. Not only did Mueller outline how receptive the Trump campaign was to Russia's election assistance, he outlined 10 key areas of obstruction of justice. But when it comes to this report, there is a new saga unfolding before our eyes. How the release of the report was handled and presented to the American people has seemingly revealed new efforts to interfere in the administration of justice, this time on the part of Attorney General William Barr. Today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing showcased Barr's dishonesty as well as the full extent of the Republican Party's sycophancy towards President Trump. The Attorney General of the United States conducted himself like the personal attorney of Donald Trump, not of the people. Senate Republicans attacked the FBI, targeted Hillary Clinton, and downplayed the Mueller report to protect President Trump's image.
MAY1	Kirsten Gillibrand wants to give everyone 600 'Democracy Dollars' – and here's why that's a truly terrible idea	2020 contender Kirsten Gillibrand, currently polling negligibly in a crowded presidential primary field, has released a policy proposal that’s making waves today: give every eligible citizen a taxpayer-subsidized 600 “Democracy Dollars” to donate towards political candidates, with $200 each designated for the presidential race, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. This, she says, is a move towards “clean elections,” because “every American’s voice should be as loud as the Koch Brothers.’” Let’s examine that. Very few Americans give more than $200 towards presidential candidates (with a maximum allowable donation of $2,700). And the ones who do tend to be disproportionately richer. But Gillibrand’s proposal is a terrible way to level the field and to undo the problems that money in politics creates. 
MAY1	The US Constitution wasn't really supposed to include all Americans — as a new Broadway play reminds us	You’d be forgiven for thinking What The Constitution Means to Me, the play appearing on Broadway through June, might be something like a history class with production design. In terms of structure and tone, playwright and lead Heidi Schreck is not unlike your most captivating teacher, except the show is definitely not about the past. After all, the United States Constitution is a living document, and we would do well to remember that democracy is a dynamic process that requires our input.  What The Constitution Means to Me interrogates the American democratic crisis, though Schreck never utters Donald Trump’s name. Instead, she tells us, when she first walks out on stage, that the whole show was born a few years ago, while she was looking at the Constitution “for various reasons” (at this, the crowd lobbed a grim chuckle.)
MAY1	I'm the person who goes through suspected rape victims' phones. Here's how and why we do it	As a digital forensic expert witness working in criminal cases involving analysing the content of mobile phones, I can understand the concerns that arose from the recent news of police demanding access to phones belonging to complainants. These concerns are particularly apparent in cases involving alleged rape or sexual offences, as it is feared people may be deterred from reporting such cases. What is not discussed – and what must be made clear – is exactly how that evidence is handled., First, even if gathered as evidence, a complainant’s phone is not always examined and will only be considered for examination if it is reasonable to do so. Second, where a phone is examined, only relevant information from it is disclosed.
MAY1	Why is Westminster Abbey holding a bizarre thanksgiving for Britain’s nuclear weapons?	There is to be a ceremony at Westminster Abbey on 3 May in celebration of 50 years of submarine nuclear weaponry. Two hundred Anglican clerics have publicly condemned the service – in their view it should not go ahead because it is at odds with church policy to “work tirelessly” for a world free of nuclear weapons. I think they’re right and the Abbey has got this very wrong. These submarines are nuclear weapon submarines. Their crews, trained to obey orders, are ready to fire missiles whose warheads will bring destruction to faraway places and people far beyond the scale of Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
MAY1	Should neo-Nazis be banned or just kept under surveillance?	The Independent has been an uncompromising defender of free speech since its foundation. We believe that the best way to fight bad ideas is with better ideas. We are biased against banning things, and in particular against banning the expression of opinions.  Our prejudice is that organisations advocating views that most people find abhorrent should not be banned. We would rather that their views be held up to public view and challenged. There is, of course, a difference between expressing obnoxious views and inciting, soliciting or organising violence. Which is why we supported the decision in 2016 to ban National Action, the British neo-Nazi group.
MAY1	Like Caster Semenya, I have hyperandrogenism. The IAAF’s ruling will hurt millions of women like us	Today, like so many people around the world, I was incensed by the latest development in the legal battle between two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya and athletics’ world governing body the IAAF. In case you haven’t followed this case closely, the IAAF decided last year to introduce restrictions on how much testosterone women competing in specific distances could have in their body.
MAY1	Why newly freed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez is so essential to Venezuela's uprising	Venezuela’s crisis has escalated to new levels. In the early morning hours of 30 April, Juan Guaidó – the leader of the Venezuelan National Assembly, who swore himself in as interim president in January – called for an uprising against President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government.
MAY1	Goodbye Gavin Williamson, we should never have seen your like in the first place	And so, in the end, it was not Russia but Gavin Williamson himself that shut up and went away. Cut off from the heart of government, cut off as he once was by Richard Madeley in front of a semi-rampant elephant in a Midlands safari park. Out of the frying pan and, in the fullness of time, back to the fireplaces.  Oh Gavin, we will never see your like again. It is nothing short of a wonder that we ever saw your like in the first place. Never happier than when Instagramming pictures of the skips you had filled at the weekend, or the microwave popcorn you so enjoy while watching back episodes of Friends. And suddenly, there you were, in charge of the fifth largest armed forces in the world.
MAY1	My fellow Americans, it shouldn’t be easier for us to imagine the apocalypse than a future with free healthcare	Hope Howard’s article (“Yes, I want universal healthcare in America – but not through Medicare-for-All”) suggested capitation budgets (payments given to providers on a per-patient basis rather than a per-visit basis) as a potential alternative to Medicare-for-All. Howard did not mention that capitation already exists in the state of Maryland, where I live. While our “all payer” model has saved money in comparison to other states struggling to finance healthcare within a for-profit system, it has also exacerbated racial and economic disparities in health.  Poor people in my state – especially children in Baltimore City – have higher levels of asthma, diabetes and permanent brain damage caused by lead paint poisoning (Freddie Gray, whose death sparked the 2015 Baltimore Uprising, was one such child). This population utilises healthcare services more often, and as a consequence of capitation in a for-profit environment, Maryland hospitals have closed less profitable areas of treatment that tend to be heavily utilised by poor people (eg, there are few remaining pediatric A&E wards in Baltimore), replacing them with more profitable new surgical centres.
MAY2	For once Trump is right about Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar — but boy did their plan work	Things didn’t go well for US Attorney General William Barr during Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. To be fair, given that reports revealed Special Counsel Robert S Mueller told Barr his four-page letter outlining Barr’s “statement of the principal conclusions” created confusion by failing to “fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of his report, it was always going to be an uphill battle. Three people who did come out looking good were Democratic senators (all presidential hopefuls by the way) Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris. Everyone including the POTUS knew it too. In an interview following the hearing, President Trump told Fox Business Network that Kamala Harris was “probably very nasty”, to Barr —  a comment that strongly suggested he hadn’t watched the hearings or been briefed fully on the exchanges. Trump added that the three Senators were “just looking for political points.” 
MAY2	I spoke to the Iranian foreign minister about Trump's impact on his country. He has a message for all Americans	Since President Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal last year, Iran has remained in the deal and abided by its commitments under the agreement. In the face of economic sanctions and mounting pressure from Washington, Tehran has not yet reacted directly and threats from Iranian officials have mostly been in rhetoric. Iranian moderates have tried to rally Europe, a key supporter of the nuclear deal, against Washington to defy economic sanctions. And Iranian hardliners, who have always opposed the nuclear deal and engagement with the West, seem to have been mostly contained until now. But much has changed over the course of the past year and Iran is now signaling that it might shift gears soon.  It is no longer just Iranian hardliners who are vocal against the United States and Europe. Moderates are slowly joining them. And unless there is a breakthrough in the Trump administration’s policy towards the country, it’s clear Tehran will continue to move further away from the West.  
MAY2	Stephen Moore has withdrawn from the Fed — but our hero with the 1980s policies and 1920s opinions isn't going far	Tragically, President Trump announced today that Stephen Moore, “a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person”, has withdrawn his name for consideration on the Federal Board Reserve of Governors. I think we can all agree this is a loss for America. In case you’re unfamiliar with the man, the myth and the legend, however, let me catch you up: Stephen Moore is someone who combines the fashion of the sixties, economic policies of the eighties and social views of the twenties in one fantastic melting-pot. He has decried women serving as refs and announcers in basketball games and questioned whether there’s a place where men can take a “vacation from women”. This was probably a desperate plea to be invited to his first bachelor party — or to become ambassador to Saudi Arabia. To be fair to Moore, the diplomatic post is the only way DC residents can be sure they won’t be bone-sawed, so you can’t blame him for trying.
MAY2	After Brexit, black women will be less safe when giving birth in Britain. Leaving the EU is dangerous	The government is planning a massive intervention in NHS maternity services, which will dramatically cut staffing levels. The move will a significant effect on the safety of women giving birth – especially ethnic minority women. That intervention is Brexit. The NHS is understaffed already. A survey of Unison members on safe staffing published recently showed that nearly half of respondents said there were “not enough staff on their shift to deliver a safe, dignified and compassionate service”, and that their workplace had used agency staff that day. Over 100,000 posts across the NHS lie empty, including 3,500 midwifery posts. The NHS is stretched ever thinner.
MAY2	Jeremy Hunt’s sudden enthusiasm for media freedom is welcome – but the UK should look at its own track record first	With press freedom and journalists under attack all over the world, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt’s decision to make global media freedom his priority in 2019 is welcome and much-needed. In a PR-friendly move as part of the UK and Canada’s international media freedom conference in London this July, Hunt recently appointed international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney as his special envoy on media freedom.
MAY2	Kirsten Gillibrand wants to give everyone 600 'Democracy Dollars' – and here's why that's a truly terrible idea	2020 contender Kirsten Gillibrand, currently polling negligibly in a crowded presidential primary field, has released a policy proposal that’s making waves today: give every eligible citizen a taxpayer-subsidized 600 “Democracy Dollars” to donate towards political candidates, with $200 each designated for the presidential race, the Senate, and the House of Representatives.

But Gillibrand’s proposal is a terrible way to level the field and to undo the problems that money in politics creates. 
MAY2	Why did May really sack Gavin Williamson? His Huawei leak stopped her cosying up to Trump	The only thing faster than Gavin Williamson’s meteoric political rise has been his dramatic fall from grace, fired by Theresa May both for leaking the National Security Council decision to permit Chinese tech giant Huawei to supply 5G infrastructure, and for his conduct during the investigation that followed. But this affair has prompted many commentators to ask whether the leaking of a decision on a major public infrastructure investment programme was such a serious offence. Why was May so furious? Part of the explanation is an old-fashioned defence of principle: as Attlee had said in 1945, “no government can be successful which cannot keep its secrets” and the prime minister was surely keen to avert a precedent that National Security Council discussions were fair game for the rough and tumble of politics.
MAY2	Gavin Williamson got burned trying to play the Tory party's ruthless leadership game	The hunt for the phantom Huawei leaker of old London Town continues. So desperate is the former defence secretary to clear his name, bizarrely swearing his innocence on his children’s lives, you wonder what Gavin Williamson might agree to next. Perhaps he will submit to a polygraph test, live on Newsnight; or turn up at some nice old village pond to volunteer to be dunked into it, just as they used to do to test for witches (if they drowned they were innocent); or re-enact the Spanish Inquisition (the Monty Python version, which no one expects).
MAY2	If the authorities can exclude Caster Semenya from athletics, why not ban the wealthy from competitive skiing?	Now that the not-very-sporting “sporting” world has come down on the wrong side of the Caster Semenya issue there are follow-up questions that need to be asked. Linking the issue of transgender athletes with a naturally born woman such as herself is a spurious red herring. Also, the nonsense spouted by UK swimmer Sharron Davies that there is a parallel between Semenya and the doped-up Iron Curtain athletes of yesteryear is bonkers. Both arguments have skewed the issue madly. Semenya is a woman. Full stop.
MAY2	Trump's threat to the Muslim Brotherhood may be a gift for Egypt's president – but it should be far more	The Muslim Brotherhood has become part of the Muslim political spectrum all over the world and its ideology has been combined with Islamic thinking for nearly a century. Now, Donald Trump is planning to designate it as a terrorist group. It is hard to argue with the logic, but it may be too little, too late. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran was given the same designation last month, the first foreign military force to receive it. Both the IRGC and the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) are pillars of the Islamic movement in the Middle East and now face travel and economic sanctions. By designating them, Trump is trying to change political Islam’s historical order in the region.
MAY3	The April jobs report reveals something about America which Trump would rather you didn't know	On paper, 1968 was a great time to be an American.  Young soldiers returning from Vietnam that June saw an economy which had just created 250,000 jobs. Middle class families saw an 8 per cent increase in their household income. GDP growth for the full year hit almost 5 per cent, an incredible number for a modern economy.
MAY3	Banning Alex Jones from Facebook is not the same as the Holocaust: a headline I never thought I'd have to write	The remaining alt-right pundits of Twitter would like you to know that being kicked off Facebook and Instagram is the same as the Holocaust. As a Jew, I am here to tell you that being kicked off Twitter is not the same as the Holocaust, not even a little.  Yesterday, Facebook — after years and years of being a hotbed of fake news and conspiracy theories — finally banned Laura Loomer, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos and Louis Farrakhan, among others, which it categorized as “dangerous individuals”.  Yesterday was also Holocaust Martyrs Remembrance Day, Yom Hashoah.  Members of the far-right were extremely excited to use this incredibly f**ked-up coincidence to achieve peak whataboutism. 
MAY3	Relax – the economy can't actually save Trump in 2020	The move was already afoot to declare President Donald Trump the economic wizard in office that his backers, if not his bankers, thought he was in the private sector — even before today’s report showing the US unemployment rate at a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent. Needless to say, that clamor from the usual suspects was repeated once the report hit, even though the details of the data are fairly average, and Trump’s influence on them somewhere between small and none. Nonetheless, persistent claims of a “new boom” are the heart of the case for electing the 72-year old Trump to a second term next year, and are central to a nagging suspicion among US elites that the president may have one more Houdini-like escape from trouble left in him. 
MAY3	Philip Hammond reckons there are votes to be had in keeping 1p coins. Well not mine	Those irritating 1p and 2p copper coins have been given a reprieve by the chancellor, Philip Hammond. He’s launched a task force to ensure that cash does not go out of circulation as more of us than ever use debit cards and phone apps for everyday purchases and thousands of cash machines are being removed from high streets.
MAY3	As an inner-city teacher, I see the appalling reality of child poverty after 10 years of austerity	As a teacher working in the inner city, the tell-tale signs of childhood poverty are only too familiar. Our poorest pupils are hungry because they haven’t had breakfast. Or tired because it’s hard to sleep in a noisy overcrowded flat. Their trousers might be too short, or their shoes falling apart. There’s damp in their flat, and no money for the gas meter either.  An appalling 4.1 million children in the UK are now living below the breadline – but as a teacher the fact that nine in every 30 children are now living in poverty sadly comes as no surprise. Rather it confirms what teachers see already: after 10 years of austerity we are failing poorer young people.
MAY3	Stephen Moore has withdrawn from the Fed — but our hero with the 1980s policies and 1920s opinions isn't going far	Tragically, President Trump announced today that Stephen Moore, “a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person”, has withdrawn his name for consideration on the Federal Board Reserve of Governors. I think we can all agree this is a loss for America. In case you’re unfamiliar with the man, the myth and the legend, however, let me catch you up: Stephen Moore is someone who combines the fashion of the sixties, economic policies of the eighties and social views of the twenties in one fantastic melting-pot. He has decried women serving as refs and announcers in basketball games and questioned whether there’s a place where men can take a “vacation from women”. This was probably a desperate plea to be invited to his first bachelor party — or to become ambassador to Saudi Arabia. To be fair to Moore, the diplomatic post is the only way DC residents can be sure they won’t be bone-sawed, so you can’t blame him for trying.
MAY3	The Conservatives lost hundreds of council seats – but their collapse is only just beginning	The Conservatives didn’t do as badly in the local elections as they might have done. They lost hundreds of council seats, but that is what unpopular governing parties do. Estimates of how the whole of Great Britain might have voted if there had been elections everywhere, including London, Wales and Scotland, suggest that the Tories and Labour ended about equal.  The BBC’s projected national vote share put the Tories and Labour on 28 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 19 per cent. That means both main parties are down from tying on 35 per cent last year, while the Lib Dems are up three points. The only reason the Tories lost so many seats is that they were last contested in 2015, the high water mark of David Cameron’s electoral success. 
MAY3	The local elections have sent a clear message – and the big parties are ignoring it	Can we learn anything from local elections? We’re repeatedly warned off even trying by those who see council elections as peculiar expressions of inchoate local interests, removed from our national political conversation. But in a time of total political paralysis these elections matter, as they give voice to a population left on the sidelines as our politicians bicker for months on end. And there was one overriding theme emerging from yesterday’s result: voters rewarded parties with clear, pro-people’s vote policies on Brexit, and punished those who support Brexit.
MAY3	It's good to be back, isn't it? We Lib Dems are here to stay	I’ve finally managed to get some sleep, but I’m still reeling from a fantastic 24 hours for the Liberal Democrats. Sure, we were hoping for good results in these local elections, but this is an absolutely decisive victory for the party and our hard-working local councillors and campaigners across the country.
MAY3	Local election results show there’s more impetus than ever for a second referendum	He is thought of as dry and vulpine, with a nice line in irony – yet what were heralded as the best results for the Liberal Democrats in decades has placed an uncomplicated, broad smile on the face of Vince Cable. So unused is Sir Vince at greeting good news for his party that you could almost hear the creaks as his facial muscles arranged themselves into such an unfamiliar contortion. At last he has something to hand on to his successor.  Not since the tuition fees fiasco poleaxed their credibility have the Liberal Democrats had so much to feel good about. Brexit, otherwise loathsome, has given them an unexpected bonus. Sir Vince decided to come out of the EU closet and tell the world that his party was, quite simply, the “Stop Brexit” party. Two words: it worked. The Greens, equally enthusiastic for Europe, also enjoyed their best night since the 1989 European elections delivered a shock third place to them. The recent Extinction Rebellion, and the powerful voices of Sir David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg, have rightly reminded voters that there is more to politics than Brexit – and the future of life on Earth is in real jeopardy.
MAY4	The ‘green new deal’ supported by Ocasio-Cortez and Corbyn is just a new form of colonialism	Scratch the surface of the current plans to decarbonise the economy and replace it with renewable energies and beneath it lays the same logic that has made the UK the 6th richest country in the world. Britain is planning to go green through a new phase of resource and wealth extraction of countries in the global south. At the heart of our economic system fuelled by the City of London is a belief that the UK and other rich countries are entitled to a greater share of the world’s finite resources irrespective of who we impoverish in doing so, or the destruction we cause.
MAY4	As an inner-city teacher, I see the appalling reality of child poverty after 10 years of austerity	As a teacher working in the inner city, the tell-tale signs of childhood poverty are only too familiar. Our poorest pupils are hungry because they haven’t had breakfast. Or tired because it’s hard to sleep in a noisy overcrowded flat. Their trousers might be too short, or their shoes falling apart.

MAY4	The Top 10: Literary characters to whom politicians are often compared	This one was started by The G-Man, who said: “Politicians’ dispositions being constantly compared to literary characters is tedious. The Eeyore comparison is the most weary. Like he’s the only character in literary history to be a pessimist.” Especially because, as Robert Wright has pointed out, Eeyore, “the most deeply contented animal roaming the Hundred Acre Wood”, is more complicated than that. Anyway, here are 10 more. 1. Mr Micawber, the clerk in David Copperfield who always believes “something will turn up”. His first name is Wilkins, if you ever need that for a pub quiz. Other common Charles Dickens characters include Ebenezer Scrooge and Uriah Heep (Mark Solomons). 
MAY4	Relax – the economy can't actually save Trump in 2020	The move was already afoot to declare President Donald Trump the economic wizard in office that his backers, if not his bankers, thought he was in the private sector — even before today’s report showing the US unemployment rate at a 50-year low of 3.6 per cent.

MAY4	Lizzo clearly overreacted to criticism – but maybe the death of the album review wouldn’t be such a bad thing	“PEOPLE WHO ‘REVIEW’ ALBUMS AND DON’T MAKE MUSIC THEMSELVES SHOULD BE UNEMPLOYED.” That is, according to American singer and rapper Lizzo, who tweeted this (in all caps) last week in response to a somewhat lukewarm review by Pitchfork’s Rawiya Kameir of her otherwise very well-received third album Cuz I Love You. She has since deleted the tweet after fans pointed out that very few freelance music journalists like Kameir are in it for the money (believe me) and that invalidating somebody’s criticism just because they wrote a less-than-glowing review of your album is more than a little bit petty. I guess, as the Lizzo song goes, the truth really does hurt.
MAY4	Compulsory vaccinations could be justified by the crisis of parental irresponsibility	Half a million children in the UK are at risk of measles because they have not been vaccinated, according to Unicef, the UN agency, last month, and the problem is getting worse.  Hence the campaign by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to persuade parents to vaccinate their children, which we report today. “Those who have promoted the anti-vaccination myth are morally reprehensible, deeply irresponsible and have blood on their hands,” he said. 
MAY4	A great showing for Remain parties at the local elections will hopefully give May and Corbyn a wake up call	The Conservatives had a net loss of 1,269 seats in the local elections; Labour a net loss of 63. Both Tory and Labour leaders maintain a Leave stance, despite there being no consensus on what a Leave deal might look like, and the votes did not go their way. The Lib Dems, the Greens and independent candidates, on the other hand, had net gains of 676, 185 and 242 seats, respectively – a combined net gain of 1,103 seats.
MAY4	Share power tools to fight climate change? This is a laughable government attempt to ignore our capitalist reality	As I sat on a train to Yorkshire yesterday, water was being handed out in small plastic bottles and hot drinks were sold in plastic cups. I want to do the best I can for the environment and the next generation, but it means devoting a lot more time to making the right decisions. Train journeys – good. On-board catering, maybe not so good.  First class passengers get real mugs to drink out of, but other passengers would need to bring their own. Leaving the train, I got in my car (diesel, bought when that was the recommended option, but now demonised) and drove through gorgeous green lanes around Bedale, to discover the area was lined with plastic traffic cones and festooned with ugly signage as people in plastic hi-vis jackets were closing off streets and marshalling pedestrians. 
MAY5	As the Gaza crisis continues, Jewish-Palestinian solidarity is growing. Netanyahu must be terrified	My first memory of the news was when I was five, after hearing that former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had been assassinated. As a Jew, my relationship with Israel developed against a backdrop of the separation barrier, settlements and the open air prison that is Gaza. The repetitive and incessant violence that occur in the occupied territories is devastating. Watching the news this weekend as more rockets and retaliatory attacks erupted once again towards Gaza, it would be easy to give in to a sense of hopelessness.
MAY5	A year after his unjust detainment in the UAE, Matthew Hedges’ fight for academic freedom is not over	One year ago, Matthew Hedges, a 31-year old Durham University PhD student from Exeter, was wrongfully imprisoned in the UAE. Matthew was in the country for two weeks to research the impact of the Arab spring on the UAE’s foreign policy. On his way home to the UK, he was detained at Dubai airport. He was then subjected to around six months of inhumane treatment and solitary confinement which Matthew described as “psychological torture”. In November 2018, the UAE authorities sentenced Matthew to life imprisonment on “spying” charges after a five-minute hearing during which his lawyer was not present.
MAY5	We need to get better at talking about suicide	“Suicide is selfish,” said my teacher. “It leaves behind the grief and trauma for those who loved you the most. It’s the cowards way out.”
MAY5	There will be no end to the Brexit saga if Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn waste time on another deal	Every crisis presents an opportunity – and Theresa May is trying to turn the Conservatives’ disastrous local election results in England to her advantage. She is warning Labour that the voters’ message to both main parties is that they must “do a deal” to bring the Brexit saga to an end. Ministers are more optimistic than their Labour shadows about a breakthrough when the two sides resume negotiations on Tuesday.
MAY5	Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, it’s time to wake up. The only Brexit solution is a second referendum	The main party leaders are the only two people left on the face of the earth who cannot see there is now only one path to stability and one way to save Britain from social, economic, political and international-credibility annihilation. Even other members of their own parties suddenly get it. I wonder if the local election results helped? Certainly, sentient beings on both sides of the Brexit divide but outside of the Westminster alternative universe got it ages ago.
MAY5	The Top 10: Literary characters to whom politicians are often compared	This one was started by The G-Man, who said: “Politicians’ dispositions being constantly compared to literary characters is tedious. The Eeyore comparison is the most weary. Like he’s the only character in literary history to be a pessimist.” Especially because, as Robert Wright has pointed out, Eeyore, “the most deeply contented animal roaming the Hundred Acre Wood”, is more complicated than that. Anyway, here are 10 more. 1. Mr Micawber, the clerk in David Copperfield who always believes “something will turn up”. His first name is Wilkins, if you ever need that for a pub quiz. Other common Charles Dickens characters include Ebenezer Scrooge and Uriah Heep (Mark Solomons). 
MAY5	How Muslims with type 2 diabetes can navigate fasting for Ramadan	The holy month of Ramadan, which sees Muslims all over the world fast during daylight hours, begins this weekend. Does having type 2 diabetes exclude a person from fasting? Not necessarily. The decision belongs to the person, but getting some advice from health professionals can help. Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia. About 6 per cent of Australian adults report they have diabetes, although this is likely an underestimate of the true prevalence.
MAY5	The ‘green new deal’ supported by Ocasio-Cortez and Corbyn is just a new form of colonialism	Scratch the surface of the current plans to decarbonise the economy and replace it with renewable energies and beneath it lays the same logic that has made the UK the 6th richest country in the world. Britain is planning to go green through a new phase of resource and wealth extraction of countries in the global south. At the heart of our economic system fuelled by the City of London is a belief that the UK and other rich countries are entitled to a greater share of the world’s finite resources irrespective of who we impoverish in doing so, or the destruction we cause.
MAY5	Compulsory vaccinations could be justified by the crisis of parental irresponsibility	Half a million children in the UK are at risk of measles because they have not been vaccinated, according to Unicef, the UN agency, last month, and the problem is getting worse.  Hence the campaign by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to persuade parents to vaccinate their children, which we report today. “Those who have promoted the anti-vaccination myth are morally reprehensible, deeply irresponsible and have blood on their hands,” he said.

MAY6	Dominic Raab’s nice wife and kitchen are no substitute for his screaming lack of a clue what to do	Some day, one day, it is at least theoretically possible that this politics column will not begin by mentioning Donald Tusk’s instruction to Britain, to not waste time, as he yielded to our request for an extension to Brexit. But that column is not today’s column. How can it be, when a country still desperately short of a way out of the Brexit mess has instead been forced to spend its Sunday staring into Dominic Raab’s kitchen? Been forced, too, to gaze upon Dominic Raab’s wife, as she tells The Sunday Times of how he used to prepare picnics for her in Hyde Park, and likes to reads The Gruffalo to his children.
MAY6	As the ‘God of Chaos’ asteroid speeds towards earth, it may end up saving us from more dangerous foes to come	The asteroid 99942 Apophis is 340 meters across, and coming our way, but it won’t get too close. On 13 April, 2029, this asteroid will zoom past the Earth, allowing scientists a close-up view of an asteroid without needing to travel to it.  Between the discoveries made by spacecraft orbiting other asteroids, Ryugu by Hayabusa 2, Bennu by Osiris ReX, and others, the asteroids which litter our solar system have turned out to be a diverse bunch of objects. But typically we have to sent robotic craft out to see them – it’s rare that they come so close to us, especially large ones like Apophis, named after the Egyptian god of chaos.
MAY6	Welcome to the world, Baby Boy of Sussex – this is what your parents should do with you	The birth of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s baby boy is, of course, an opportunity for curmudgeons everywhere to moan about the cost that will be borne by the taxpayer for his upkeep and education, and generally to moan about our class-ridden society and its bewilderingly ready acceptance that some human beings are “better” than the rest of us simply by being “royal”. Quite right too, but I’d like to be a little more constructive about the new sprog, and suggest (seeing as I’ll be part funding it via PAYE) some positive things that Hazza and Megs can do. After all, the royal family is supposed to set an example. Here goes.
MAY6	Beware the siren call of a new Brexit referendum	The Independent’s latest editorial eloquently makes the case for a Final Say referendum, just as that same case is made passionately in your daily letters page.  Feelings are running high and clearly many are convinced another vote will provide the answer that our political leadership seems unable to find. Yet we need to be careful that wishful thinking on how the public mood might be shifting does not take us down a path of yet more divisive uncertainty. 
MAY6	There will be no end to the Brexit saga if Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn waste time on another deal	Every crisis presents an opportunity – and Theresa May is trying to turn the Conservatives’ disastrous local election results in England to her advantage. She is warning Labour that the voters’ message to both main parties is that they must “do a deal” to bring the Brexit saga to an end.

Certainly, sentient beings on both sides of the Brexit divide but outside of the Westminster alternative universe got it ages ago.
MAY6	The online blindspot in the fight against electoral fraud is proving an impossible nut to crack	Who doesn’t get a teeny bit excited when the post comes through the letter box? A birthday card, perhaps; or notification of a big, £25 win on the premium bonds. True, it could be a bill, but if you’re really lucky you might see a political leaflet on the door mat. There, staring up at you, will be the smiling face of your local MP, who has a message for you about how hard he’s working to make sure there is plenty of affordable housing for everyone – but how’s he’s working even harder to ensure it’s not built in his constituency.
MAY6	A petulant Donald Trump requires an adult response from China and Iran	No weapon, it seems, large or small, novel or traditional, lethal or merely limited to 280 characters, is neglected when Donald Trump is in a mood to throw his weight around. And when he does decide to go on the offensive, America, as well as the rest of the world, gets hurt. Whether it is a couple of random, economically illiterate, tweets about the trade war with China; or the dispatch of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (plus associated bomber force) to the waters off Iran, Donald Trump never tires of picking a fight. Venezuela, China, Iran, Mexico, Nato, Africa, Canada… the list is impressive.
MAY6	Charity is not just for Ramadan – even ‘positive’ media portrayals of Muslims are becoming a problem	Ramadan is here and Muslims all over the world are embarking on holy month. During Ramadan, Muslims are expected to fast from sunrise to sunset and it’s also a time for internal reflection, prayer, charity and reconnecting with loved ones.  People will also try and connect with people within (and outside) of their communities with special emphasis on those who are most in need. In Britain, mosques will open up soup kitchens and zakat (charity) will be highly encouraged. 
MAY6	How many bank holidays do you get every year? With a bit of effort, it could be more than you think	Happy bank holiday. As in the Great British tradition, albeit recently sometimes disrupted by climate change, it is reassuringly cold and overcast and the telly is mostly uninspiring. You will also, quite understandably, probably be having a day off work for reasons you don’t quite understand. When I told a devout socialist the other day that he would soon be celebrating the international workers festival of May Day he pulled a face and pointed out that, no, here we all are at work on Wednesday 1 May. The connection between global class struggle and the administrative convenience of setting the date for the nearest Monday for a long weekend involving lager, pizza and boxed sets of Game of Thrones was not made. There you go, comrade.
MAY7	Trump doesn't want a war with Iran — but he might get one anyway	The chances of war between Iran and the United States have just increased again. A small mistake from either side could now lead to dangerous results — and easily escalate into a disaster for both sides, as well as the entire Middle East. US National Security Advisor John Bolton announced that the US is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the Middle East in response to "troubling and escalatory indications and warnings" from Iran yesterday.
MAY7	The truth is that in the Trump tax return controversy, everyone is in the wrong	Donald Trump is ready to engage in another battle with Congress, and this time it’s over his tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a letter to House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Richard Neal (D-MA), refusing to turn over six years of President Trump’s tax returns — likely setting up a court battle that will make its way to the Supreme Court.
MAY7	Britain's heartless justice system is turning our children into a generation of career criminals	 A criminal history leaves a legacy that lasts a lifetime. Forget the PR about offender rehabilitation: as anyone holding a criminal record will tell you, life after a conviction is more difficult. Doors are closed, opportunities rescinded, chances quashed. And in Britain, we’re closing down the life chances of more children than anywhere else in Europe.

MAY7	I became a slave to ready meals – here's why I broke the habit of a lifetime	Speaking at the Stratford-upon-Avon Literary Festival last week, Prue Leith (she of the glorious glasses and statement necklace combos) passed comment on the nation’s lack of culinary prowess. She maintained that we haven’t learnt to cook for three generations and that while this is no real biggie for the middle classes, who can buy as many ready meals as they like, it puts poorer families who can’t cook at a disadvantage.  She’s right, the middle classes don’t need to cook to survive, those who can afford it can eat around the globe on a nightly basis, without dirtying anything more than the microwaveable trays their dinner comes in.
MAY7	Istanbul’s mayoral election re-run will only make Erdogan weaker	The banging of the pots and pans began at night time, shortly after Turkey’s high election commission voided 31 March Istanbul mayoral elections won by opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered a 23 June re-run. The clamour crescendoed into a roar that spread throughout the city, drawing in housewives and students, young and old, some of whom flooded into Istanbul’s streets in protest.
MAY7	The deadline to register to vote in the EU elections is today – it's crucial that young people make our voices heard	Every election is determined by those who show up. For me, this fact is all the more powerful because of what it means for my generation. Too often, young people do not show up, and our future's are decided by others.  It's because of this that I'm part of Vote For Your Future – an organisation that was set up just a couple of weeks ago, by young people of all political backgrounds. Young Brexiters and Remainers may not agree on much, but we can agree that this year's European Elections are some of the most important in a generation, if not ever. This is why we need to do everything we can to ensure young people are registered, informed and able to take part.
MAY7	Nigel Farage is betraying his own voters	Credit where it’s due. It had not yet been 24 hours since Nigel Farage had been on the Sunday politics shows, warning of the “final betrayal” that was coming. And here he was, not even waiting for it to come, but delivering it himself. The Brexit Party, the party Farage set up himself to contest the European elections he so desperately does not want to be contesting, was holding a press conference to announce it was betraying its own voters.
MAY7	The release of Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar proves that diplomacy can still work	Anyone in any doubt about the worth of Her Majesty’s ambassadors should look to the work of Dan Chugg, “our man” in Myanmar, for some inspiration. The release of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, disgracefully incarcerated in solitary confinement for six months by the Myanmar authorities, is at least partly down to Mr Chugg and his colleagues’ dedicated and clever work. He did not simply lobby Myanmar’s rulers, usually impervious to foreign entreaties about human rights, but instead also constructed a careful case based on the local legal system, demonstrating that their detention was unlawful. As it happens, it worked. Although no one can prevent the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt from trying to make political capital out of this happy turn of events, it is a moment to recall that, even in Britain’s denuded circumstances, the right kind of diplomacy can make a difference. It is also, parenthetically, worth recalling how Boris Johnson might have got on – the man who was filmed humming “On the Road to Mandalay”, a colonial-era anthem about the then Burma, during an official visit.
MAY8	The time has come to impeach Donald Trump — just look at the US Constitution	The time has come to impeach Donald Trump. Not because I believe Trump meets the minimum criteria for impeachment set forth by his own Republican Party in the 1990s, nor because 370 former prosecutors say Trump would be charged with Obstruction of Justice if he weren’t a sitting president, but because impeachment is exactly how our founders and framers envisioned their newly formed government to function if they were ever to be in our current situation.  Further, impeachment can be used as a powerful tool to inform the public, frame the common narrative, and assist in winning the next election. In order to understand both of these, we must first dig deeper into how and why the impeachment provision was inserted into the United States Constitution in the first place.
MAY8	Brian Kemp and the state of Georgia promises to protect you — so long as you're not born yet	Abortions after six weeks of pregnancy will now be illegal in the state of Georgia, after Governor Brian Kemp signed a “fetal heartbeat bill” into law this morning which prohibits doctors from performing abortions after there’s a detectable heartbeat. At six weeks, a fetus is the size of a pea, and doesn’t have arms, legs oorr a face. It doesn’t have a neural tube connecting the brain to the spinal cord. It is, essentially, one missed period. But it now has more rights than the living, breathing, thinking, feeling mother it’s implanted inside. I once saw a woman carrying a baby with the slogan “Now that I’m safe, I’m pro-choice” emblazoned on it (i’m still not sure whether she was a liberal with a dark sense of humor or a pro-lifer trying to make a point through the age-old medium of infant fashion.) It made me laugh guiltily, which I presume was the intended reaction. A lot of people could have accused it of being in poor taste. I can’t imagine sales were astronomical.
MAY8	The European elections could tell us everything we need to know about Brexit	The outcome of the forthcoming European parliamentary election will remove the ambiguity attributed to the result of recent local elections and help political leaders decide how to approach the Brexit deadlock. Specifically, a higher electoral turnout and a meaningful change in favour of parties and candidates supporting a second referendum would indicate the need to trust the public with shaping the future of their country after almost three years spent on getting nowhere.   Hamid ElyassiLondon E14
MAY8	Students are turning to memes for mental health support because university pressure is so bad	“When u bout to sleep and hear a noise downstairs but you don’t gotta pay student loans if ur murdered.” 20,000 likes and retweets. It’s a pretty bleak time to be a student, to say the least. One in four students has mental health problems. Almost a third of graduates end up in jobs they’re overqualified for. Our chances of owning a home are half what it was for our parents. And of course, that’s if climate change doesn’t kill us all first.
MAY8	Britain's heartless justice system is turning our children into a generation of career criminals	 A criminal history leaves a legacy that lasts a lifetime.

MAY8	Mike Pompeo spells it out: When it comes to trade, Britain is basically a tramp waiting at America’s bins	Three years and roughly eight million political lifetimes ago, a man called Barack Obama stood in a room in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and told Britain that if it voted for Brexit it would go “to the back of the queue” for a trade deal with the USA. Britain, you may know, ignored that advice, and yet, for some mystifying reason, it appears to find itself not to at the front of the queue, and not even at the back of the queue. But rather, its role is now that of a tramp, waiting hopefully at closing time by the bins out the back of America.
MAY8	If Trump is so ‘smart’, why can't he see the blindingly obvious when it comes to his murky tax affairs?	So now we know why Donald Trump has been so cagey about his tax returns. Partial versions of these dating from 1985 to 1994 have been obtained and published by The New York Times. They show that Mr Trump, then a property developer, amassed losses of some $1.17bn over that decade. Substantial by any standards, they were by far the largest registered by the Inland Revenue Service for any American taxpayer in the period. Mr Trump claims, with some plausibility, that they were tax losses, used for reducing his bills from the IRS. Such techniques are certainly commonplace in the real estate world and elsewhere. However, the sheer scale of the losses, their persistence and the lack of evidence for the profits they were supposed to cover raise questions about just how robust Mr Trump’s businesses were during the Reagan and Clinton years. We already know that his plans for casinos and an airline came to little.
MAY9	Trump's taxes revealed something conservatives have been trying to hide for years. So how will ordinary Americans respond?	Shortly before she went to prison for tax evasion in 1989, real estate magnate Leona Helmsley, the Queen of Mean, was famously quoted in the New York Times: “We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.”  After this week’s reporting in the same newspaper that Trump claimed tax losses of over $1bn in a similar time frame and didn’t pay taxes for eight of 10 years from 1985 to 1994, Donald Trump had his Leona moment: “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes,” he tweeted, “it was sport.” So long before Trump was spending his presidency cheating at golf, he played a different sport: tax avoidance.
MAY9	Danny Baker’s excuses don’t cut it – the impact of racism is inseparable from the intent	The excuses vary, but they amount to the same thing. “I didn’t mean it.” “It’s a joke.” And, as of yesterday, when BBC 5 Live presenter Danny Baker was alerted to the racist connotations of tweeting a photo which appeared to compare the newborn royal baby to a literal ape, he said: “Sorry my gag of the little fella in the posh outfit has whipped some up. Never occurred to me because, well, mind not diseased.” We can take him at his word, call it an oversight and forgive his classic response that only “real bigots” attack people knowingly. The trouble is that when we look at the history of humour and racism in Britain, it’s clear that they have remained linked on just this kind of nod and a wink. Baker has paid a price, but we have let these “jokes” slide without so much as a slap on the wrist for too long.
MAY9	Arsenal’s callous response to a dying fan shows us what football has lost	For many Arsenal fans, it was one of the most exciting parts of the match-day experience. The team bus would pull up outside Highbury and supporters who had waited by the stadium entrance could cheer as the players walked past them, just inches away. The look on kids’ faces when their heroes returned their wave was wonderful. 
MAY9	The level of stress and overwork placed on GPs like myself is dangerous – something has to give	I work as a GP in a large practice in Bristol and my workload has reached unmanageable levels.  
MAY9	The European elections could tell us everything we need to know about Brexit	The outcome of the forthcoming European parliamentary election will remove the ambiguity attributed to the result of recent local elections and help political leaders decide how to approach the Brexit deadlock. Specifically, a higher electoral turnout and a meaningful change in favour of parties and candidates supporting a second referendum would indicate the need to trust the public with shaping the future of their country after almost three years spent on getting nowhere.   Hamid ElyassiLondon E14
MAY9	On the banks of the Tigris, the lost grave of Scottish shepherd David Bell takes us deep into Iraq’s bloody past	This is the story of an elderly lady in Lincolnshire, a long-dead Scottish shepherd and a kindly Shia Muslim in southern Iraq. First, the lady. Moira Jennings, who is now 87, wrote to me from her home in England when I was covering the aftermath of the disastrous – and illegal – 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq. We would exchange letters several times in the coming years. But her words are more eloquent than mine: “My Grandfather was killed on 22nd April 1916 and is buried in Amara War Cemetery, Iraq. He was in the Black Watch, left the farm in Scotland where he was a Shepherd and never returned, as did so many men in the First World War. As a child I spent a lot of time with my Grandmother who had my Grandfather’s medals in a frame on her wall. I asked her about them and she told me he had been killed in Mesopotamia by the Turks. To a child this made a lasting impression on my mind and I’ve tried to find out more.”
MAY9	Mike Pompeo spells it out: When it comes to trade, Britain is basically a tramp waiting at America’s bins	Three years and roughly eight million political lifetimes ago, a man called Barack Obama stood in a room in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and told Britain that if it voted for Brexit it would go “to the back of the queue” for a trade deal with the USA.

MAY9	Local authorities should crack down on MPs for their divisive political antics. Lives are quite literally at stake	With campaigning for elections to the European parliament underway, a diverse group of charities, human rights organisations and community groups has come together under the auspices of the TUC to call on politicians to take a stand against the hate speech that is becoming all too common in today’s Britain. Amnesty, the Fawcett Society, Citizens UK, the Community Security Trust, Hope not Hate, Stonewall, TellMAMA, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Show Racism the Red Card, and many more besides have urged political parties to “take all necessary steps during the European parliament election campaign to eradicate hate speech and false claims that divide our communities”.
MAY9	Labour’s Brexit Position is so unambiguous, no one can decide how ambiguous it is, or isn’t	We’re in EU elections campaign season proper now. The leaflets are coming through the door, the people are being asked to choose who they want to represent them for an unspecified period of time of anywhere between five years and zero days, in a parliament they are meant to have left already. In such times, it is perhaps best to keep it simple. The Brexit Party – clue’s in the name. The Tories are not campaigning and may not bother to send a leaflet at all. The Liberal Democrats have gone with “Bollocks to Brexit”, nothing if not snappy. Snappier, certainly than “exotic spresm” and easier to pronounce. Change UK Now The Independent Group With No Logo may also, it turns out, not be sending out the completely free leaflet they are allowed to send to every household in the country under Electoral Commission rules. There has been some kind of technical oversight, we have been told. Something to do with them not having sent one in, and the deadline for doing so being a date that is earlier in the year than today. 
MAY9	Danny Baker’s naivety has cost him his job – and, after 40 years at the BBC, rightly so	Less than 24 hours after broadcaster Danny Baker posted a tweet which could be considered racist, he paid the price for his misjudgement. The BBC acted swiftly and removed him from air. In response to the arrival of the first heir to the British throne of mixed-race heritage, Baker had shared an image of two adults and a monkey dressed in an overcoat and top hat with the caption “royal baby leaves hospital”.
MAY10	This is not just another 'why I'm leaving New York' essay	For a certain kind of writer, the lure of the “Why I’m Leaving New York” essay is inescapable. The notion of entering one’s very own version into the canon is like catnip to the bodega cat they like to think they’ve befriended, and the essay format itself is so overdone as to be beyond parody (though McSweeney’s did a tidy job of it here). It’s all so gauche and self-indulgent — aw, yet another nice girl from the country couldn’t hack it in the big city and now she wants us to give a crap about her “journey” — and the derision the glut of such essays has produced online is surely justified. I swore I’d never write one, because up until very recently, I never thought it would come up. In general, self-reflection, nostalgia, and all those other emotional things aren’t really something I’m comfortable trafficking in; I write about politics and culture, not my feelings (not that there’s anything wrong with doing so, it’s just not how my brain works). 
MAY10	If Don Jr doesn't want to answer his subpoena, he could just go and hide in a very secret, hidden place: his father's tax returns	President Trump has said he was “quite surprised” to learn that his son, Don Jr, has been subpoenaed by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee. “Don Jr is not my brightest child — if the Intelligence Committee wanted to increase their intelligence, they should have invited Ivanka,” he probably remarked. Of course, this wasn’t the President’s first reaction as this news broke. I’m assuming Trump first learned about the subpoena from a Fox News chyron which said “Lucky Don Jr wins a free trip to DC: Finally Something Good Happens To A White Family”. As he watched Fox News, I’ll bet Trump was particularly impressed with Laura Ingraham’s description of Don Jr as “DJ”. He didn’t know that any of the Trumps had fingers long enough to scratch records.
MAY10	Uber is in a tight squeeze. Its drivers are revolting and even its excited IPO investors have got nervous	Wall Street’s flashiest car seems to have got a puncture.  Uber had pundits excitedly talking about a $100bn (£77bn) valuation when it announced plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
MAY10	The UK can’t fight the climate emergency when the Tories are entirely opposed to renewables like solar	Anyone who lives in the UK would suspect that solar power could never be the complete solution for its energy demand. Overcast days in the depths of winter would produce meagre amounts of electricity even if the nation was covered with solar panels. But that does not mean solar has not got an important place in the transformation of the UK to a zero carbon nation. This includes solar panels installed on homes that can power much of a household’s energy requirements for large parts of the year. So why does the UK government appear to be intent on frustrating the deployment of solar power?
MAY10	Mea Culpa: trouble brewing on the Nigel Farage front	Very sad to hear about Nigel Farage. Nothing’s happened to him, I’m just sad to hear about him.” I am reminded of this comment of Moose Allain’s quite often these days. It is particularly pointed for me, because I predicted in public in 2014 that “in five years’ time we will have forgotten who Nigel Farage was”.  So I am specially sorry that he is now back in the news. Early this week there was speculation that he might even stand as a candidate in the Peterborough by-election. One of our columnists wrote that, if he were finally elected to parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts, “he’d be in prime position to ferment that sense of betrayal from the backbenches”. 
MAY10	Arsenal’s callous response to a dying fan shows us what football has lost	For many Arsenal fans, it was one of the most exciting parts of the match-day experience. The team bus would pull up outside Highbury and supporters who had waited by the stadium entrance could cheer as the players walked past them, just inches away. The look on kids’ faces when their heroes returned their wave was wonderful. 
MAY10	When you watch Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, don't think of Ted Bundy. Think of murder victims like my sister	Survivor’s guilt rears its head in some of the strangest ways sometimes. A survivor of a traumatic experience can find themselves feeling that sinking feeling doing the most mundane and normal tasks such as talking to friends, preparing for a life event, or even watching a film. This might sound ridiculous to some who haven’t gone through it. You might not have that same sucker punch overhearing friends say how they’re “dead” with laughter or “want to strangle someone” over someone frustrating them. You might not get the same wretched creeping feeling as you look at your calendar trying to hype yourself up about a birthday, only to remember that you’re about to become the same age as your sister when she was murdered, and suddenly you’re not sure how you feel about it anymore.
MAY10	Absolute destruction by Andrew Neil leaves Ben Shapiro absolutely destroyed	A cursory Google investigation into the life and works of Ben Shapiro reveals a Game of Thrones-style existence. Sixteen consecutive hours rarely pass without Ben Shapiro having been absolutely destroyed, or Ben Shapiro absolutely destroying someone right back. Where Ben Shapiro leads, absolute destruction surely follows. And on Friday where he went was to a television studio in Los Angeles, to be interviewed down the line by the BBC’s Andrew Neil. And – spoiler alert – what followed was the most spectacular Game of Owns episode yet, of the complete-self variety.
MAY10	Labour’s reluctant leaders hold the key to a Remain coalition against Farage	Donald Tusk, Anglophile, former Polish premier and president of the European Council, has said he estimates the chances of Brexit being cancelled are about 30 per cent. It sounds about right, given that the UK has spent the best part of three years trying to work out a workable “good Brexit” – and failing. Mr Tusk’s rough calculation mirrors that of financial markets. The momentum is palpably falling away from the Brexit movement, poleaxed, as it has been, by its internal contradictions. It is as if the British had applied for a three-year distance-learning course in why having your cake and eating it is a logical impossibility. We are about to receive our degree certificate.
MAY10	Is the parade of Tory wives designed to distract us from the dull and desperate candidates?	Amber Rudd complains that some male candidates pushing themselves forward to replace Theresa May are guilty of "parading" their partners, commenting "this shouldn’t be some Game of Thrones push for the Iron Throne, we’ve all got important jobs to do".  She's right. The battle to appear "normal" to the rest of us outside Westminster is well underway. 
MAY11	Is Boris Johnson going to fail at the last moment to become prime minister – again?	If there is a Conservative leadership election this summer, Boris Johnson will probably win it. A survey of Tory party members last month had him seeing off all rivals in run-off contests – Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid.  I understand that Conservative HQ is already divided between pro- and anti-Johnson factions – one working for the incoming prime minister; the other trying to resist his arrival.
MAY11	Unlike Extinction Rebellion, I know the harsh reality of prison – it’s not about good literature and meditation	For most of my life the threat of prison has loomed not far away. I grew up in a kinship network which, in order to materially survive, engaged in illegal activities that regularly led to custodial sentences. During my teens and twenties, days of sex work, street level drug dealing and small time thieving did not pass without the possibility of ending up in custody, and many of us did. I lost nearly half a decade of my life to the prison industrial complex. At no point did I find transcendence, nor did it “mature me” as Extinction Rebellion suggested it might. What prison did do was further traumatise me and push me down into poverty and violence. As a political organiser and activist in my thirties, I engaged in direct action that I knew would put me back into custody. Locking myself to diggers at coal mines, blockading arms manufacturers and deportation flights, I knew the likelihood of arrest was high, and a court appearance was very possible, but that prison was unlikely. I was arrested but never charged for other offences or sometimes I was just brought in for questioning. I often organised meetings in which plain clothed police would be parked outside my home or the community centre at which the meetings were held. All of this stemmed from the choices I made to try and engage with what I viewed to be the structural cause of the existential threat we were facing, namely the economic system of capitalism.
MAY11	The Top 10: Accidental Inventions	This was proposed by Josh Blacker several years ago, but sometimes the wheels of the trivia list machine turn exceedingly slowly. He suggested Post-It Notes, which came about when 3M (originally the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company) was trying to invent a new strong glue. Here are 10 more.  1. Cornflakes, 1894. Will and John Kellogg, Seventh-day Adventists, experimented with producing vegetarian food in 1894. Having allowed some wheat to go stale, they tried rolling it flat and baking it. It was popular, and they tried it with maize, which was even better. Nominated by Paul A Davies. 
MAY11	This is not just another 'why I'm leaving New York' essay	For a certain kind of writer, the lure of the “Why I’m Leaving New York” essay is inescapable. The notion of entering one’s very own version into the canon is like catnip to the bodega cat they like to think they’ve befriended, and the essay format itself is so overdone as to be beyond parody (though McSweeney’s did a tidy job of it here). It’s all so gauche and self-indulgent — aw, yet another nice girl from the country couldn’t hack it in the big city and now she wants us to give a crap about her “journey” — and the derision the glut of such essays has produced online is surely justified. I swore I’d never write one, because up until very recently, I never thought it would come up. In general, self-reflection, nostalgia, and all those other emotional things aren’t really something I’m comfortable trafficking in; I write about politics and culture, not my feelings (not that there’s anything wrong with doing so, it’s just not how my brain works). 
MAY11	Mea Culpa: trouble brewing on the Nigel Farage front	Very sad to hear about Nigel Farage. Nothing’s happened to him, I’m just sad to hear about him.” I am reminded of this comment of Moose Allain’s quite often these days.

MAY11	Yes, I'm deaf. But that doesn't always mean I can't hear what you're saying about me	Ironically, I’ve heard all the same deaf jokes before. Sorry? What? Pardon? Whenever I tell someone I wear hearing aids and have a mild hearing loss, the odd few like to try their luck. It may seem harmless, but as the deaf community celebrates Deaf Awareness Week, the retort is likely to emerge once again and reinforce the damaging misconception that deaf people are ignorant, stupid or cannot listen.
MAY11	Sod the Rich List, we should be publishing a ‘Tax Contributor’ list that can be a badge of honour	It’s that time of year when Britons are presented with the opportunity to drool over the wealth of the nation’s richest citizens at the breakfast table once again.  Yes, The Sunday Times is preparing to publish its annual Rich List, which is inevitably one of the biggest and most widely discussed stories on the day on which it lands. 
MAY11	It is the country’s future that matters, not the prime minister’s	The more the Conservative Party obsesses over Theresa May’s future, the more it seems to be focusing on the wrong issue. She has fended off questions about when she might stand down so far, and she has asked to speak to representatives of her party’s MPs on Thursday to explain herself.  As we report today, Sir Graham Brady, the genial figure struggling to be impartial at the head of the mob with the pitchforks, said: “We have asked a question. She’s coming, I assume, to answer it.”
MAY11	Jeremy Corbyn will be remembered as the great enabler of Brexit	Principled and courageous? Diane Abbott’s piece on Labour’s stance on Brexit beggars belief. On Brexit Corbyn has only one “principle”: to end free movement. His “courage” is to bury this in half-baked cakeism. Corbyn will be remembered as the great enabler of Brexit and the destroyer of the Labour Party.
MAY12	Nigel Farage was banned from his local for allegedly crashing a car and walking away. Britain should do the same	Nigel Farage’s latest pre-election vehicular accident was less serious than his last. Interviewed this week, he reflected sombrely on the light aircraft crash on the morning of the 2010 general election. “I’ve come out of it. It’s nine years on. I’ve come out of it. I’m physically a bit damaged by it, but not that badly.”
MAY12	What happened to Britain’s black avant-garde fiction writers?	When I turned 17 I started fantasising vividly, almost involuntarily, about meeting Virginia Woolf. We’d be gossiping, chain-smoking and downing glasses of champagne at her Mecklenburgh Square flat in London, obviously. Sometimes Duncan Grant (with whom, like many other queer teens, I was having a passionate affair) would be there, sometimes EM Forster or Ottoline Morrell.
MAY12	Of course I’m jealous of the Rich List. But at least they’re spending their fortune here	The Sunday Times Rich List ceased to have much fascination for me from around the time – some years ago – when it finally dawned on me that I would never see myself appear in it. I know, delusional. So envious am I still, though, irrationally and pathetically, of the characters who do turn up there that I just don’t want to know the painful details about how many hundreds of millions they are up or down this year, or why.
MAY12	What no one tells you about the shame of being fired	I’ve just been fired. Well, that’s not strictly true: I was fired on Thursday last week, which came as a huge surprise. It was every bit as upsetting as I’d imagined it’d be, but it was also incredibly surreal: the big moments in life never feel quite as if they are truly happening. Following a quick cry as I left the office, one thought stuck with me: why on earth aren’t more people talking openly about the experience of being let go?
MAY12	Why the world may soon ‘forget’ Kenya’s Lake Kamnarok	  By Dan Kaburu for People Daily in Kenya
MAY12	Africa's second largest home of crocodiles fast vanishing as ox-bow lake gets drained	  By Caroline Chebet for The Standard in Kenya
MAY12	India should have a coalition government – at least that way, we’d be less fractured	India has never been as fractured as today along religious lines, during the past 70 years of freedom. This is horrendous. Muslims and Christians are a part of India. It is unfortunate that the ruling BJP party and prime minister Narendra Modi did not foster a more all-inclusive model of democracy and economic development. By his telling silences, when minorities were hurt or harmed in India, Modi indirectly blessed fragmentation. India is a test-tube democracy for the world to watch: Can a nation with varied religious and cultural hues, political polarisation and economic distress, survive and prosper within a democratic framework?
MAY12	Forget the polls. Even if the Brexit Party succeed at the European elections, it’ll have no impact on Brexit	Nigel Farage, predictably enough, has shown his usual knack for grabbing the headlines. A professional politician and former City boy – you might say a member of the elite – Mr Farage is experienced and cunning enough to know exactly what to do when in a tight corner in a BBC interview: attack the BBC and play victim. It didn’t work with Andrew Marr, who retained his cool and pressed Mr Farage on some of his more eccentric pronouncements. It will make little difference to the Marmite-esque Farage. The nation has long since divided itself into those who love him and those who despise him. Mr Farage’s demand to have Brexit Party MEPs in on the negotiations in Brussels is the usual kind of ludicrous stunt.

MAY13	You shouldn't be surprised that Trump praised Viktor Orban. But you should be angry	On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who, despite leading his country since 2010 (and a previous term that ended in 2002), had yet to receive a formal audience with a US president. That’s not an accidental oversight: so severe has the criticism been against Orbán over allegations of corruption and abuses against the press and marginalized communities that in his previous visits to the United States, Presidents Bush and Obama declined to meet with him. And yet, for anyone paying attention to this administration, it’s hardly surprising. Giving access to troubling anti-LGBTQ, anti-press, anti-freedom leaders is Trump’s modus operandi. It’s a defining characteristic of his presidency. After persistent paid lobbying from former Congressman Connie Mack over the past 18 months, Trump rolled out the red carpet for the strongman, who has been rebuked by everyone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to European Commission Presidents José Manuel Barroso and Jean-Claude Juncker. Sitting side-by-side in the Oval Office, Trump described Orbán as a “tough man”, adding “but he is a respected man” and “a highly respected leader all over Europe, a little bit controversial maybe but that’s OK. You’re doing a great job to keep your country safe.”
MAY13	Should we really support Hollywood actors threatening to boycott Georgia — even if we support their pro-choice aims?	The heads of several independent production companies have announced their intentions to boycott filming in the state of Georgia after the signing into law of an anti-abortion “foetal heartbeat bill.” Among them are David Simon, Christine Vachon, and Mark Duplass. Alyssa Milano has also vowed not to return to Netflix’s Insatiable if the show continues to film in Georgia, and on Friday proposed a “sex strike” on Twitter — drawing scorn from some feminist allies. 
MAY13	Guilty verdicts in Montenegro’s coup case solve nothing and leave a country beset by protests and corruption	After 19 months, the long-awaited verdict in the trial of 14 people accused of plotting to overthrow the government of Montenegro and assassinate its prime minister has arrived. Two Russians, who prosecutors said were intelligence officers, were convicted in absentia, and others are beginning long prison sentences following a volley of guilty verdicts that have caught many people in the Balkan state by surprise.  Such are concerns over the case, opposition members from the Democratic Front have expressed fears that the verdict risks “irremediably destabilising” the country. Given what we know about politics and the rule of law in Montenegro, however, perhaps the outcome is really not such a surprise.

MAY13	Millennials are having less sex – but only because we’ve raised our standards	How important is sex to you? I’m asking because the recent news that British people are having less sex than ever before has got me thinking about the value of intimacy, and why abstaining from sex is often seen as an act of penance instead of one of self-love. According to a three-stage study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the the British Medical Journal in May 2019, regular sexual activity between couples is on the decline.
MAY13	What happened to Britain’s black avant-garde fiction writers?	When I turned 17 I started fantasising vividly, almost involuntarily, about meeting Virginia Woolf.

MAY13	The Home Office threatened to deport a woman in a coma – it’s like the Windrush scandal never happened	It was only a year ago, but if government policy is anything to go by, it’s almost as if it never happened. Last spring, in what quickly became known as the Windrush scandal, the devastating impact of some of the most pernicious parts of government immigration policy were splashed all over newspaper front pages and dissected in TV news segments. In a country where anti-immigration politics is the default, the immediate fallout was unprecedented. Issuing somewhat half-hearted mea culpas as they went, politicians who had just months before been peddling xenophobia, promised to change policy and change the debate – as if they had previously nothing to do with either. The UK’s immigration system would become more “humane”, newly-appointed home secretary Sajid Javid pledged; we’ll improve the way we talk about immigration, MPs from across the political divide promised. It seemed like there might be a shift – but Bhavani Espathi is one of many people whose experience shows just how little has changed.
MAY13	Like Trump, Nigel Farage stands for nothing but himself. It’s up to us to oust him at the EU elections	Last week’s column on Nigel Farage provoked outrage from Brexit Party supporters, and even some of their candidates, who have been bleating on about how unfair it was for me to describe their hero’s politics as hard right, xenophobic and nationalistic.   Apparently, because the Brexit Party is standing candidates of immigrant backgrounds, Farage cannot be guilty of promoting anti-immigrant sentiment. What utter garbage. When he was leader of Ukip, that party put forward candidates of immigrant backgrounds and no one could argue with a straight face that Ukip did not have a racism and anti-immigrant problem then – they still do now.
MAY13	Brexit will find no resolution in pointless cross-party talks, but it will in a second referendum	It is “crunch week” for the talks between the government and opposition on Brexit, according to ministers. The problem is that they have been saying that for some weeks now. There was a brief glimmer of hope after both the Conservatives and Labour performed poorly at this month’s local elections in England. But there has been precious little sign of progress since.
MAY13	The mysterious ‘sabotage’ of Saudi oil tankers is a dangerous moment in Trump’s pumped up feud with Iran	Saudi Arabia’s claim that two of its oil tankers have been sabotaged off the coast of the UAE is vague in detail – but could create a crisis that spins out of control and into military action. Any attack on shipping in or close to the Strait of Hormuz, the 30-mile wide channel at the entrance to the Gulf, is always serious because it is the most important choke point for the international oil trade.
MAY14	Once the best friend of John McCain and now chief Senate sycophant, Lindsey Graham is the personification of the GOP's decline	“Article 3 of impeachment against Richard Nixon: the article was based on the idea that Richard Nixon, as president, failed to comply with subpoenas of Congress. Congress was going through its oversight function to provide oversight of the president… The day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is the day that he was subject to impeachment…” Is that quote from an impassioned House Democrat calling for President Trump to comply with their numerous subpoenas and over 20 investigations? No. That was Lindsey Graham in December 1998, who at the time was a Republican representative of South Carolina's 3rd District making the case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. How times have changed.
MAY14	The James Charles vs Tati Westbrook feud proves it: YouTube influencers no longer hold all the power	It has been the most extraordinary deserting of a celebrity by their audience in history. Over the course of a weekend, 19-year-old beauty vlogger James Charles – who managed to bring Birmingham to a standstill earlier this year because of his devoted fanbase – has seen his audience on YouTube disappear at an alarming rate.
MAY14	Like a shameless loyal hand to Queen Cersei, Olly Robbins has returned to Brussels for more pointless Brexit talks	Technically it qualifies as a headline, but it reads more like a crude schoolboy parody of nihilistic pointlessness. “Olly Robbins heads to Brussels,” the BBC website reported last night. By now, the prime minister’s chief EU negotiator will have arrived for what are drolly styled as “further talks”.
MAY14	Guilty verdicts in Montenegro’s coup case solve nothing and leave a country beset by protests and corruption	After 19 months, the long-awaited verdict in the trial of 14 people accused of plotting to overthrow the government of Montenegro and assassinate its prime minister has arrived.

MAY14	Britain is slipping behind on LGBT+ rights just as it leaves the EU. It's no coincidence	With UK politics so intensely focused on Brexit, it might be easy to forget that, as Britain’s international reputation continues to suffer, there are important domestic issues requiring the government’s attention. Yet if you’re someone who depends on government legislation to allow you to lead a healthy or safe life, it might be harder to forget. This week, LGBT+ organisation ILGA-Europe has announced its 10th Rainbow Europe Map and Index. The annual list is designed to rank 49 European countries on LGBT+ rights and equality. Troublingly, it has revealed that some countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary and Turkey are regressing as existing laws and pro-LGBT+ policies are disappearing.
MAY14	James Brokenshire can talk his ovens down all he likes, but there will still be four of them, not two	“It’s never the crime, it’s always the cover-up.” So goes an old saying that goes back to Watergate. But never before has the cover-up involved seeking to partially obliterate the crime with a four-year-old Victoria sponge. And never before has the crime been that of having significantly more ovens than the court of public opinion will allow. We turn, in these rarefied hours in the life of the nation, to the open-plan kitchen of communities and local government secretary James Brokenshire, and the four ovens hiding in plain sight therein. And we turn, more specifically, to Mr Brokenshire’s decision to have himself, his wife and his ovens photographed for the weekend’s newspapers.

MAY14	Iran isn’t making arrests, it’s taking British hostages. And it’s doing it because it works	The arrest of a London-based British Council employee, 32-year-old Aras Amiri, while she visited family back home in Iran, is a sign that the Iranian regime is locked into a game which reflects the sharp divide between conservatives and reformers. President Hassan Rouhani is helpless. The arrest of journalists, dual citizens and Iranians who live in the west is the work of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The IRGC has an immense network of political and financial interests in Iran. Some estimate that it controls as much as 40 per cent of the Iranian economy. It was a staunch opponent of the anaemic nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015.
MAY15	Alabama is just the beginning — this Republican strategy goes way beyond abortion rights	This week, Alabama Republicans lurched the United States closer to a Constitutional crisis with the passage of a bill banning abortion from the moment of conception, and punishing doctors who protect the lives of women with up to 99 years in prison.  A cabal of 25 Republican men drew the curtain on abortion rights in Alabama, where only three women sit in the state Senate. Their monstrosity of an abortion bill provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, creating a perverse scenario where a woman’s rapist could be out of jail in as little as two years, while a doctor who provides the same woman an abortion would die in prison.
MAY15	As tensions with Iran escalate, the question we should all be asking is: who's really in charge in the White House?	Because of escalating tensions with Iran, Donald Trump may face his first true test of presidential leadership. The problem is that the administration keeps sending mixed signals, and it raises the question of who is calling the shots.  This morning, the State department ordered the departure of non-emergency US government employees from Iraq and warned US citizens not to travel to the country, citing a “high risk for violence and kidnapping.” That news followed a New York Times report that said the administration has a plan to send up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacks any American forces or continues a nuclear buildup. 
MAY15	Child poverty is a threat to the stability of the nation	The many potential successors to Theresa May try to portray themselves as One Nation Tories, with varying degrees of conviction. Yet, in the near-decade that Britain has been ruled by Conservative governments, the country has become ever more unequal, in income, in wealth, in equality of opportunity and, most poignantly, among children. There may be valid reasons for some of the economic decisions that had to be made after the financial crash, but when the record of the British government in the 2010s is assessed, the impoverishment of the young will be one of their most shameful chapters. The headline statistic is that some half a million more children are living in poverty than was the case at the start of this decade. This is according to the government’s own “households below average income” data which showed that child poverty, once housing costs are factored in, rose by this figure between 2010 and 2018. In some parliamentary constituencies, though usually not Conservative-held ones, more than half of children are growing up in poverty. Impoverished areas have seen the greatest increases in child poverty, particularly in big cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. Child poverty extends to the working poor.  
MAY15	Forget Uber, it’s Julian Richer who has shown us how to save capitalism – by giving away his business	Richer Sounds founder Julian Richer made quite a splash when he announced that plans to share the company’s wealth by handing control of the business to its staff through the creation of a John Lewis style trust. His workers’ cups runneth over because they are also to receive bonuses.  Some 60 per cent of the company is being transferred into an employee trust. The business is paying him £9.2m for this, but some £3.5m of that is being handed back to staff who will receive £1,000 for every year of service. The average payout amounts to £8,000. 
MAY15	Like a shameless loyal hand to Queen Cersei, Olly Robbins has returned to Brussels for more pointless Brexit talks	Technically it qualifies as a headline, but it reads more like a crude schoolboy parody of nihilistic pointlessness. “Olly Robbins heads to Brussels,” the BBC website reported last night. By now, the prime minister’s chief EU negotiator will have arrived for what are drolly styled as “further talks”.
MAY15	Pete Buttigieg can get black voters like me on his side — but he'll have to be brave enough to make certain changes	A recent poll by the Post & Courier demonstrated something my black activist and political friends and I had been saying for weeks: Mayor Pete Buttigieg has a black voter problem. Most starkly, the poll reveals that Mayor Pete has nearly no support among black voters in South Carolina, where they make up two-thirds of the Democratic primary electorate. So any momentum Buttigieg gains in Iowa and New Hampshire (where black people constitute 2 and 3 per cent of the electorate respectively) will be halted in South Carolina, causing him to limp into Super Tuesday (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia) after a crushing, highly visible defeat.  Unless, that is, Buttigieg addresses his issues with black voters now. 
MAY15	Soldiers shouldn’t be allowed to get away with murder – but neither should the leaders who sent them to war	That war is a messy business is hardly a radical notion. The process of reparation and justice reflects this. It is chaotic, painful, emotionally charged and, at best, partial. These truths are borne out in the saga of the legacy prosecution cases that continue to emerge from Britain’s occupations of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Yet there is more to these cases than just the pain of victims and their families. These allegations and the processes around them have become highly politicised – hijacked, if you will – and used by the government and the military in an effort to protect the British state against laws and conventions that might someday interfere with our customary pursuit of foreign policy goals through military violence.
MAY15	The government’s voter ID scheme is a dangerous step towards electoral suppression in the UK – just look at America	Though the Conservative government would like to convince us otherwise, there’s simply no evidence that voting fraud is even slightly an issue the UK. Electoral Commission data suggests that in 2017 there were 28 cases of voter fraud at polling stations. Even if these identified cases of represent only, say, a quarter of the true number of incidents, the total number would still be insufficient to swing a single constituency. Spread out across the entire country, they’d equal roughly one fraudulent vote per every six MPs. Knowing this, it’s hard not to feel furious at preliminary reports on a second trial of compulsory voter ID during the recent local elections. In the eight test areas that have so far given figures, a total of 819 people were turned away from polling stations and didn’t return. That’s an average of around 80 people per test area denied a democratic voice. A small number in the grand scheme of things, perhaps, but a worrying indication of the direction we could be heading in.
MAY15	Theresa May has reduced the bottom of the barrel to a single atom	It’s possible, just possible, that we’ll miss these times when they’re gone. It has been suggested that Wednesday lunchtime’s instalment of the May vs Corbyn show will be one of the very last. When she loses the fourth vote on her Brexit deal in three weeks’ time, as she inevitably will, she will surely have to quit. That’s what people are saying in Westminster, even if others are saying the direct opposite and nobody can possibly know. But when she does go, I would like to think it is not for any of these reasons, but merely because there is no bottom of the barrel left to scrape. They have, between the two of them, reduced the unscraped surface to the thickness of a single atom.
MAY16	If you think Beto is 'born to do it' and Kamala is a 'great VP for Joe', you need to change your attitude. And fast	The 2020 election should be hailed as historic, because it is. Of the 23 Democrats currently in the running, six are female, with frontrunners like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris working hard to lay out their platforms to the public. But a quick glance at the headlines paints a very different, unbalanced picture. We see female candidates still taking a back seat to their male opponents all too often. Beto O'Rourke landed a (controversial) splashy Vanity Fair cover in March to kick off his campaign, and not even two weeks ago, a smiling Pete Buttigieg posed with his husband on the cover of Time, compete with the headline “First Family.” And, of course, Joe Biden is still ahead in the polls. No female candidate (yet) has landed a magazine cover. Instead, female candidates seem to be up against something far more sinister than politics itself: the relatability factor.
MAY16	US-Iran tensions are escalating at an alarming rate, thanks to well-rehearsed gun diplomacy	A threat based on intelligence reports; deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Middle East with reports of ground troops to follow; a dramatic rise in diplomatic tensions and warnings of retribution from Washington. All this as the Iran crisis escalates may well seem like a reprise of what unfolded before the disastrous last Iraq war.
MAY16	Elizabeth Warren proved she was a leader by refusing to be used by Fox News	This week, Elizabeth Warren announced that she would not be participating in a Fox News town hall, branding the propaganda machine masquerading as a news network “a hate-for-profit racket.” In a series of tweets, she elaborated on why she’d chosen to refuse their invitation: “Hate-for-profit works only if there’s profit, so Fox News balances a mix of bigotry, racism, and outright lies with enough legit journalism to make the claim to advertisers that it’s a reputable news outlet,” she explained. “It’s all about dragging in ad money — big ad money.” Noting Fox News has recently struggled to keep advertisers as criticism of the network and some of its biggest stars —Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham in particular — continue to grow, the Democratic presidential candidate effectively said she would not allow her name to be exploited in an effort to lend them the legitimacy they need to keep generating revenue. 
MAY16	Momentum is stretching its policy muscles – now Corbyn should heed its message on Brexit too	Momentum, long dismissed as little more than a youthful fan club for Jeremy Corbyn, is growing some intellectual muscles. While a welcome sign of an increasing interest in the business of what a Labour government should be about, it also carries risks – not least to the leadership itself. A four-day working week, the abolition of immigration detention centres and the Green New Deal – aiming for Britain to go zero carbon by 2030 – are the first solid policies that Momentum will be throwing its considerable weight behind at the party conference.
MAY16	It took years of therapy to understand the issues behind my mental health – to blame it all on social media is naive	Nothing feels more defining of entering my twenties than the honest conversations I’ve had with female friends about our mental health. From exam stress and low self worth, to self-harm, depression, and anxiety, it feels like we’ve all been through a lot in the last few years. And whether that’s to do with being more open with each other as we grow older, or struggling without the support systems of childhood, one thing often strikes me: it seems like every young woman I know has faced some battle with their mental health.
MAY16	A joint 2020 ticket with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on it isn't what progress looks like	It’s hard to get away from talk of the 2020 election and aside from Trump, former vice president Joe Biden seems to be getting the most airtime. As Biden continues to climb in the polls, rumors abound that so-called “middle class Joe” (he’s not middle class) could form a dream team with former California Attorney General and now Senator Kamala Harris. But if this is the ticket the Democratic establishment ends up pushing, then they are reading Americans wrong. The third time isn’t always a charm. When I first read that the Congressional Black Caucus, among other Democrats, were suggesting that a Biden-Harris ticket was being thrown around as a winning combination to beat Trump, I wasn’t surprised. In an effort to make his ticket more diverse, McCain was the first to try out this strategy in 2008, when he made the terrible decision to nominate Sarah Palin as his VP. Not that Palin and Senator Harris are comparable, because they have almost nothing in common as people. But the way in which a woman, and in this case a black woman, has been thrown into the conversation to balance out an otherwise typical campaign (think wealthy white guy running for president) is familiar. 
MAY16	Brexit makes Labour look shifty and dull. This is how Momentum’s policy blitz can reboot Corbynism	Through campaigns to open up Labour’s selection processes, win left-wingers seats on the NEC, and mobilise activists to get out the vote, Momentum has proved itself to be an asset to Corbynism, inside and outside the party. But when it comes to policy, and especially when it comes to challenging the leadership, the activist organisation has been relatively mute. That’s why the group’s decision to push Labour to adopt ambitious new policies at this year’s party conference represents a genuine departure. When Labour rocks up in Brighton this year, instead of wrangling over rules, we can expect grassroots campaigns supporting a Green New Deal, a four-day week and the abolition of all detention centres.
MAY16	The defence secretary’s move to let veterans off in times of war will open the floodgates for oppression	Penny Mordaunt’s claim that the UK could opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights in times of war opens the gates of oppression. Rights abusers habitually declare a state of emergency or war to justify their wrongdoing. Remember, we are in a long term war with terrorism.
MAY16	There are herds of Tory leadership candidates as far as the eye can see – but not a principle in sight	It’s reported that 30 Tory MPs have suggested they might stand for leader, which is understandable as the Conservative Party has offered up such a wide range of impressive leadership qualities over the last three years. If you’ve helped steer the country so calmly and wisely in recent times, it’s only fair you should have a chance to be prime minister, in the same way Prince Philip must think that having displayed his driving ability, he should now be allowed to race Formula 1 cars for Mercedes.
MAY16	Jeremy Corbyn’s plans to nationalise the energy grid are needless and impractical	Perfect timing? Labour unveiled its plan to bring the National Grid back into public ownership as part of a “green industrial revolution” on the day the part privatisation of the probation service was reversed.  The latter was an unmitigated disaster. It cost the nation £500m according to the National Audit Office. After that, even applying the word “Calamity” to Chris Grayling, who oversaw the move while at the Justice Department, might be under selling it. 
MAY17	Republicans want you to know they care about the sanctity of human life so much they're willing to kill for it	This week the GOP’s war on women kicked into high gear with the signing of the most anti-choice anti-choice bill since the advent of the internet.  Of course, this bill was brought to you by the state that ranks 50th in education. 
MAY17	Beto O'Rourke, I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed	I’m not in the habit of feeling sorry for privileged white men, but I have a smidgen of sympathy reserved for Beto O’Rourke. Part of that is rooted in me typically wanting the best for any non-Republican Texan because as a fellow native, I know the heat is bad enough so must we suffer fools, too? But with O’Rourke in particular, I’m genuinely perplexed at how he has somehow managed to rapidly bungle a credible chance at becoming the next president of the United States by turning into what increasingly looks like the political equivalent of the reflective Justin Bieber bop “Sorry.”  This week, O’Rourke sought to reset what has become an increasingly irrelevant bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It started with an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show in which he conceded that “I recognize that I can do a better job, also, of talking to a national audience." Personally, I was most intrigued by O’Rourke’s acknowledgment that America’s meddling in the affairs of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua coupled with the War on Drugs contributed to migrants fleeing to the US through the years, but the admission that he could have done a town hall by now or whatever is what garnered headlines. 
MAY17	What we now know about Bernie Sanders' foreign policy views should disqualify him from running for president	The New York Times this morning released a report on Bernie Sanders' foreign policy activities before his time in Congress that appears to show him aligning with Ortega, Castro, and the Soviet Union. As mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he spent a great deal of time traveling internationally and proclaiming on foreign matters in service of an "anti-imperalist" ideology that seemingly led him to support authoritarians.  In one vivid example, Sanders is reported to have said, “You are worms” to George Crile, a prominent CBS journalist, while scolding American reporters for not reporting “the truth” about Nicaragua.
MAY17	My mums’ WhatsApp group chat is a window to the world of modern parenting – but it also feels like the 1950s	It takes a village to raise a child, but in this age of austerity, a couple of WhatsApp groups will do.  Like any social group, WhatsApp groups can be useful, supportive, but also occasionally irritating and riddled with social pitfalls. “Shappi Khorsandi has left the group” will only ever sound passive-aggressive and faintly portentous, so I just never leave. I would hate for anyone to think that I’m not fully invested in their three-week investigation into whether the fox who raided the bins on the 15th was the same fox that someone’s mum saw in the alley by the Co-op on Saturday afternoon with ripe mango in his fur.
MAY17	Mea Culpa: a dystopian future of filler phrases all over the world	“Global” is a word that should be used with care. Perhaps I have been sensitised to it by the government slogan, “Global Britain”, which may have been intended to suggest an outward-looking, free-trading, post-Brexit nation. That now seems more quaint than annoying, but the word often strikes a wrong note.  We described Seattle as a city “whose core activities shake the world – through technology, philanthropy or global development”. If “global development” means the city’s effect on the world economy, that is mostly covered by “technology”; and if it means aid to the developing world, that is probably covered by “philanthropy”. 
MAY17	It is unsurprising that the cross-party Brexit talks have collapsed	It is unsurprising that the Brexit talks between the Labour and Conservatives have collapsed. As an electorate, we have been asked to choose between bad and worse. Both parties claim have the moral high ground and to be able to usher in a fairer and prosperous society. In practice, no one ever has ever come up with plausible solutions to eradicate poverty, social inequalities and injustices, homelessness, discrimination or how to rebuild clean renewable energy, social care, the NHS, transportation and other public services in the face of grinding austerity.

MAY17	I've had a sneak peek at Trump's points-based immigration plan — and it's pretty wild	The Trump administration announced plans to overhaul US immigration policy this week, in a bid to transition from a system that promotes family-based migration to one that emphasizes skills. The administration is proposing a points-based system to evaluate aspiring migrants along four dimensions: skills, finances, English-speaking ability, and civics knowledge. No one has yet seen the specific test which Trump wants to be applied, although a draft written by Jared and Ivanka Trump was leaked to the press last night. Luckily your correspondent has seen the leak and can report on its contents:
MAY17	The EU elections prove that voters on all sides want to have their say on Brexit – the only way forward is a new referendum	Almost the only thing that Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have in common is that neither wishes to be blamed for the collapse of their cross-party talks about Brexit, upon which so few hopes for the future of Britain were pinned. Although the more rationally minded Keir Starmer and David Lidington probably did engage on the tricksy detail, with ever more elaborate schemes to find some middle ground on “a” or “the” customs union or customs “arrangement”, the talks were doomed to fail. That was because it was never in Corbyn’s interest to play midwife to any kind of Tory-led Brexit, because Labour was genuinely fearful of what a post-May Conservative prime minister might do, and because both party leaders had in common an almost allergic reaction to a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal.
MAY17	Four times the US has made the same mistake in the Middle East. Now Trump is making it yet again over Iran	In its escalating confrontation with Iran, the US is making the same mistake it has made again and again since the fall of the Shah 40 years ago: it is ignoring the danger of plugging into what is in large part a religious conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims. I have spent much of my career as a correspondent in the Middle East, since the Iranian revolution in 1979, reporting crises and wars in which the US and its allies fatally underestimated the religious motivation of their adversaries. This has meant they have come out the loser, or simply failed to win, in conflicts in which the balance of forces appeared to them to be very much in their favour.
MAY17	Can we put an age limit on fashion when the ‘model of the year’ is only 17?	At last, leading designers and publishers have agreed to stop using models under the age of 18 in editorials and on the catwalk.  Francis Pinault, chief executive of the Kering Group which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, St Laurent and McQueen, made the commitment this week at a conference for the fashion industry in Copenhagen, along with the the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Kering is following Vogue publishers Conde Nast, which made a similar commitment last August. Yet in December Kaia Gerber, the daughter of former supermodel Cindy Crawford, was crowned “Model of the Year”. She’s just 17 and walked the catwalk in Stella McCartney’s show earlier this year. 
MAY18	Nigel Farage claims Leavers are the true democrats – this is why he’s wrong	Parliament’s inability to agree a withdrawal deal meant the UK did not leave the EU on 29 March. Theresa May’s government confirmed a new target date of 31 October with Brussels. This gives fresh hope to those wanting Brexit softened, if not cancelled, as progress remains stalled. This is more of a trick than a treat for Leavers. Delaying Brexit is seen as a denial of democracy. The problem is no longer reasserting Britain’s sovereignty, but defending our democratic politics. To oppose Brexit is linked to being against democracy itself.
MAY18	No, Madonna, your Eurovision performance will do nothing to heal the wounds wrought by Israeli apartheid	In the last few years of his life my father suffered from dementia. It was hard to talk to him about his likes and dislikes because he didn’t always remember what they were. Along with his deteriorating health he gradually began to lose interest in almost everything, but his love of music persisted. He was a dedicated audiophile who spent years building a special listening room. We spent hours there listening to Bruckner, Fayruz, Bowie, Mahler, Gregorian Chants, and Madonna. Lots and lots of Madonna. First on records, then on CDs, and then on laserdiscs. My father was almost 90 when he passed away. His life was really good and full of love – it was as fair a deal as humans get. Born in the mid 1920s in British occupied Palestine, he fought against the British Mandate in the Jewish Irgun (we still have a gun that he stole from a British soldier when he was 14), forged passports in Italy, lost an eye from a grenade blast and was still an extraordinary painter. When telling us stories about those times he always insisted that life just carried him places, that he did not choose the paths he took because there was no choice.
MAY18	The pitfalls of protest votes in the time of Brexit	European elections have long been seen in this country as an opportunity for a protest vote. For many citizens, furious at the failure of the government to take Britain out of the European Union, that is all this Thursday’s vote will be.  But voters should remember they are also sending representatives to the European parliament – and they will have a job to do for however long they are there. 
MAY18	The top 10: ‘People’s’ things	This was Ian Reeve’s idea, prompted by the Communist Party of Britain calling for a “People’s Boycott” of the European elections. The CPB is the party (membership 734) that broke away from the CPGB in 1988, taking the Morning Star with it. It didn’t put up candidates in 2017 and supported the Labour Party because it was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Now it says we shouldn’t vote on Thursday because we should have left the EU. Here are 10 more.  1. People’s Party. Affectionate term for the Labour Party. 
MAY18	My mums’ WhatsApp group chat is a window to the world of modern parenting – but it also feels like the 1950s	It takes a village to raise a child, but in this age of austerity, a couple of WhatsApp groups will do.  Like any social group, WhatsApp groups can be useful, supportive, but also occasionally irritating and riddled with social pitfalls. “Shappi Khorsandi has left the group” will only ever sound passive-aggressive and faintly portentous, so I just never leave.

MAY18	Broke and sold a lie, Jeremy Kyle’s guests were the victims of our broken capitalist system	There are plenty of reasons to dislike Jeremy Kyle, most of which have been rolled out again this week in light of the tragic death of Steve Dymond, one of the show’s recent guests. Responses range from those who want to see greater care for guests put in front of the anxiety-inducing gaze of the camera to those who – perhaps rather patronisingly – demanded that ITV cancel a show that they never liked or watched anyway. What’s really needed, however, is not increased help or “aftercare” for the select few who appear on the show, nor necessarily its cancellation, but the acknowledgement of a much wider problem embodied by these recent events: the link between economic conditions and mental health.
MAY18	Republicans want you to know they care about the sanctity of human life so much they're willing to kill for it	This week the GOP’s war on women kicked into high gear with the signing of the most anti-choice anti-choice bill since the advent of the internet.  Of course, this bill was brought to you by the state that ranks 50th in education. 
MAY18	I’m standing to be an MEP because I want the East Midlands to become Remain	Until I was selected as an EU election candidate by Change UK, I had thought my last day in politics was 23 June 2016  –  referendum day. Unlike other candidates on Change UK’s regional list for the East Midlands, I have a background in politics. I have been a Labour parliamentary candidate in a target seat, and worked in regional and national roles for Britain Stronger in Europe (BSiE).
MAY18	If Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, Scotland will vote to leave the UK	Like many in this affluent South Edinburgh constituency I "should" be a Conservative voter – I’m over 60, well educated, involved in business and reasonably well off. I’m not of course – I’m a member of the Lib Dems as their values are closest to mine and the Conservatives have alienated multitudes of decent people through their appalling decisions in government.  But like many here I actually vote Labour in parliamentary elections. How so, given Labour seems to have been taken over by Marxists? Primarily it’s tactical to keep the SNP candidate out, but we are happy to do so because our local Labour MP, Ian Murray, is such a strong candidate who doesn’t simply follow the party line on all matters and is not a Corbynite.  He is seen as his own man, a man of conviction driven by fundamental issues of social justice.
MAY19	We’ve lost the point of Eurovision – it’s a platform for performers, not governments	Any event garnering millions of pairs of eyes, lots of key players with vested interests and a slew of diverse, often conflicting, opinions is always going to bring about tension. It just so happens that this week, and let’s face it a lot of the lead-in, has concerned the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC). The world’s biggest live music show and longest-running live song competition – with an audience averaging over 200 million annually, mixing performers, fans and delegations from over 40 countries – has rarely been staged without ruffling a few feathers.
MAY19	I spent thousands covering my body in tattoos during a bipolar mania episode – but I don’t regret it	In April 2016, I started covering myself in tattoos. I have bipolar disorder, and I was at the start of a manic episode – something which often happens to me around this time of year. Bipolar disorder is categorised by two episodes: mania and depression. Each can last from weeks to months, and both can be just as debilitating. I was experiencing something called hypomania – a lesser form of mania, but I still felt as though my mind was racing a mile a minute. Mania often includes symptoms such as feeling on top of the world, euphoric, even. However, there are some downsides – such as feeling quick to anger, being very irritable and snapping easily.
MAY19	My rapist confessed, and the police dropped my case – no wonder women are taking matters into their own hands	In 2016, whilst asleep in a hotel room in London, I was raped by a man I knew. Like most victims of rape, I didn’t report it straight away. I didn’t want to go through the further trauma of a police investigation, especially without any evidence apart from my word. Then, two weeks later, and completely out of the blue, the man who raped me sent me text messages from his adopted home abroad. Those messages amounted to an apology and a confession for what he had done to me. With trembling hands and voice, I finally reported the rape to the City of London Police in the belief I now had irrefutable proof of my sexual assault.
MAY19	The pitfalls of protest votes in the time of Brexit	European elections have long been seen in this country as an opportunity for a protest vote.

MAY19	I’m standing to be an MEP because all Europeans deserve to live healthier lives, for longer	I am a longevity biologist, startup founder and philosopher based in Cambridge, and I’m standing as an independent MEP candidate in the East of England constituency. I’m also a cross-border candidate; a citizen of another EU country; a continental European; an intellectually satisfied science immigrant; and a native of Budapest, Hungary.

MAY19	Theresa May’s ‘bold offer’ on Brexit is nothing to get excited about – but a second referendum is	Next month Theresa May will present to parliament what she calls a “bold offer” on Brexit – a new and improved version of the deal that has been turned down three times by MPs. This follows the breakdown of talks between her and Jeremy Corbyn, where she sought to find a compromise deal that Labour might be prepared to accept.
MAY19	Boris Johnson will make for a disastrous Tory leader. What will it take for the public to realise that?	A new poll has shown that members of the general public back the Latin-quoting Billy Bunter figure called Boris Johnson as the future leader of the Conservative Party. What on earth is wrong with people? He is the man who lied about £350m extra a week for the NHS on that famous bus.
MAY20	Republican Justin Amash says Trump has done enough to be impeached — but it's the Democrats who will suffer	As the country gets closer to summer and people prepare for the doldrums in Washington DC, the past weekend had a spark when Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) came out and said President Trump committed impeachable offenses after reading the 448-page Mueller report.  Amash became the first Republican to break ranks with his party, and it invited immediate scorn from some fellow Republican colleagues. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) accused Amash of seeking “attention” and of taking a contrarian position on impeachment for the sake of doing so. 
MAY20	As an American doctor, I think you deserve to hear the truth about our healthcare system	Every year, American taxpayers spend more than $39bn through the National Institutes of Health to fund medical research to discover new lifesaving treatments and drugs. American patients risk their health and sometimes even jeopardize their lives to test whether these new drugs are safe and effective during clinical trials.  When the time comes to reap the benefits, however, Americans pay much higher prices for the same drugs that patients within universal healthcare systems overseas can obtain at much lower cost. This is in spite of the fact that Americans sacrifice so much more to help bring these drugs to market. 
MAY20	I was exiled from Rwanda years ago – this is what standing up for the rights of my people cost me	In June 1994, I witnessed the massacre of three Catholic bishops and a number of priests by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. One of those murdered was my uncle. At the time I was a newspaper editor in Rwanda. I had written previously about the persistent problem of injustice in the country where killers are promoted within military ranks and the government administration, and allowed to go on killing thousands of innocent people. This itself had brought me to the attention of government, but after the murder of my uncle, the pressure intensified.
MAY20	I spent thousands covering my body in tattoos during a bipolar mania episode – but I don’t regret it	In April 2016, I started covering myself in tattoos. I have bipolar disorder, and I was at the start of a manic episode – something which often happens to me around this time of year.

MAY20	People of colour have more to offer than our trauma. It’s time the media recognised that	There is a trend in the way people of colour (POC) are treated in the media. It’s an issue that has been discussed, but in my experience, quickly brushed off – only spoken of in hushed tones among a trusted circle of like-minded friends. In the UK, we discuss varying forms of media bias all the time. What we do not do, however, is address the media’s obsession with pigeonholing POC to the extent that they’re only allowed to speak on certain issues that specifically relate to their racial identity and more often than not, their trauma.
MAY20	Nigel Farage getting hit by a milkshake isn’t funny, it’s absolutely hilarious	Nigel Farage has been hit by a milkshake and a nation holds up a mirror to itself. Is it acceptable to laugh at Nigel Farage having had a milkshake thrown at him? Is an act of violence against a politician, however small, however lactic, ever OK? There are so many weighty questions that must be worked through with great care and patience. We’d best get started. Would it be funny if Nigel Farage were to be hit with a strawberry milkshake? Strawberry, soft seed of England. Wimbledon, straw boaters, narrow punts gliding under long shadows, longing for times that never were... a sudden explosion and all of this streaks suddenly down the flapping pinstriped trousers of an angry, nanoscopically thin-skinned charlatan. Yes it would.
MAY20	The Game of Thrones finale cast aside its objectified women, just like classical literature taught us to	Game of Thrones is finally over, complete with an unexpected victor and a viewership divided in frustration over the ending. Part of what drives this frustration is, I suspect, the identity of the winner. Bran the Broken might be the first elected monarch in Westeros’ history, but he is also a uniquely odd contestant in this competition, primarily because his participation has been so marginal. Bran represents the series’ interest in storytelling, sure, but his elevation snubs all the characters who played out the action so faithfully for eight long seasons: characters who have schemed and betrayed, suffered and died, all for the vague promises of a power that was only ever wielded by the show’s writers and showrunners.  
MAY20	Is Google’s Huawei ban just another way for Donald Trump to pass on his dirty work?	It is often said that the most powerful man in the world is the president of the United States of America. It’s a bit trite but probably true nonetheless, and all the more worrying when that man is Donald Trump. Certainly Trump has demonstrated that a US president can have a serious impact on global affairs in various sectors. His approach to diplomacy has unsettled the status quo without quite destroying it, while his “America first” economic policy has put presumptions about the mechanics of global trade under intense pressure.
MAY20	I’m standing to be an MEP because I’m sick of politicians frustrating the Brexit process	I have lived in Wales for the past 12 years with my wife and two children who were both born in the country. I love the Welsh people and its countryside where I spend a lot of my spare time mountain biking around the hills and valleys. My attachment to the country and my experience of seeing Brexit being frustrated is why I'm standing as a Brexit Party MEP candidate for the area.  For the past six years I have worked on producing key economic indicators at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in Newport and for the past 18 months I have been head of UK trade, helping to deliver a multi-million-pound transformation of the government’s official trade statistics.
MAY21	Trump thinks the North Korea blueprint will work with Iran. He's dangerously wrong	Over the past week, I have spoken to Iranian men and women who are critical of the Islamic Republic, who have been working toward a free and democratic Iran, and who have paid a high piece for their activism, including detention, forced migration and exile. They have told me a lot of things, but one opinion unites them all: war with the US would be a disaster for political reform and democracy in their country.  A military conflict with the world’s strongest army will put hawkish Commanders in charge in Iran. It will give them enough power to crack down on what is left of a domestic political opposition. A grave existential threat to the Islamic Republic will encourage its most paranoid elements to further securitize the social and political sphere and wrap up all internal dissent.
MAY21	Theresa May’s offer of a vote in parliament on a second Brexit referendum is a trap	It’s a trap. Theresa May’s offer of a parliamentary vote on a fresh referendum, as part of the last-ditch attempt to pass her Withdrawal Agreement Bill sounds fantastic. You might imagine it to be some sort of death-bed conversion by the prime minister, who has previously refused even to consider such an idea – but it is anything but.     
MAY21	Yes, a vote for Labour this week will help stop Brexit, but it will also achieve much more than that	In the hundreds of hours spent in Parliament debating Brexit, I constantly think of how we could have spent our time better.  I imagine the legislation on housing, health, education and social improvement that could have been passed; the infrastructure that could have been built; the national humiliations we could have avoided. Maybe, in this alternate future, I would still be running as a Labour candidate in the forthcoming European elections for the beautiful South West region, but the argument would have been about a better Europe not just stopping Brexit.
MAY21	I was exiled from Rwanda years ago – this is what standing up for the rights of my people cost me	In June 1994, I witnessed the massacre of three Catholic bishops and a number of priests by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. One of those murdered was my uncle. At the time I was a newspaper editor in Rwanda. I had written previously about the persistent problem of injustice in the country where killers are promoted within military ranks and the government administration, and allowed to go on killing thousands of innocent people. This itself had brought me to the attention of government, but after the murder of my uncle, the pressure intensified.
MAY21	I spent thousands covering my body in tattoos during a bipolar mania episode – but I don’t regret it	In April 2016, I started covering myself in tattoos. I have bipolar disorder, and I was at the start of a manic episode – something which often happens to me around this time of year. Bipolar disorder is categorised by two episodes: mania and depression. Each can last from weeks to months, and both can be just as debilitating. I was experiencing something called hypomania – a lesser form of mania, but I still felt as though my mind was racing a mile a minute. Mania often includes symptoms such as feeling on top of the world, euphoric, even. However, there are some downsides – such as feeling quick to anger, being very irritable and snapping easily.
MAY21	European elections: Remain parties need just 'one more vote' than Brexiteers for success, says Change UK leader	Remain parties securing “one more vote” than the combined forces of Ukip and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party would represent “success” in the European elections, the interim leader of Change UK Heidi Allen has said. Ms Allen told The Independent that she “sweats” over the worry that the new party is splitting the Remain vote in the 23 May elections to the European parliament.
MAY21	I can’t stand Nigel Farage – but even I wouldn’t throw a milkshake at him	A few years ago, back in the halcyon days of the Cameron/Osborne double act of everyday cruelty and incompetence, some bright spark set up a “slap George Osborne” webpage, where you could – surprise, surprise – slap an image of Osborne’s face to your heart’s content, complete with a comedic slap sound for good measure. I am not a perfect person and I may (historical accounts differ) have spent more time on that page than would seem strictly necessary for a grown-up with a job and responsibilities. And now, more than ever, there are plenty of politicians and personalities who make me want to headbutt myself into unconsciousness against my TV screen whenever I see their gurning, smug faces. If there was a “smush butter into Tommy Robinson’s hair” page for instance, I’d never get anything else done.
MAY21	Legalising cannabis in the UK will leave the working classes behind – just as we’ve seen in America	When the home secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that medical cannabis would soon be available on prescription, thousands of patients who rely on illegal supplies to relieve the symptoms of MS, epilepsy and other conditions were delighted. (Although, as Tory ex-minister Mike Penning highlighted in parliament on Monday, patients in need of cannabis have found gaining access to it extremely difficult). Nonetheless, many recreational users too, have welcomed this as a possible first step towards full legalisation, as recently introduced in the US and Canada.
MAY21	The Game of Thrones finale cast aside its objectified women, just like classical literature taught us to	Game of Thrones is finally over, complete with an unexpected victor and a viewership divided in frustration over the ending. Part of what drives this frustration is, I suspect, the identity of the winner. Bran the Broken might be the first elected monarch in Westeros’ history, but he is also a uniquely odd contestant in this competition, primarily because his participation has been so marginal. Bran represents the series’ interest in storytelling, sure, but his elevation snubs all the characters who played out the action so faithfully for eight long seasons: characters who have schemed and betrayed, suffered and died, all for the vague promises of a power that was only ever wielded by the show’s writers and showrunners.  
MAY21	Is Google’s Huawei ban just another way for Donald Trump to pass on his dirty work?	It is often said that the most powerful man in the world is the president of the United States of America. It’s a bit trite but probably true nonetheless, and all the more worrying when that man is Donald Trump. Certainly Trump has demonstrated that a US president can have a serious impact on global affairs in various sectors. His approach to diplomacy has unsettled the status quo without quite destroying it, while his “America first” economic policy has put presumptions about the mechanics of global trade under intense pressure.
MAY22	When you're a young black Republican being loud on the internet, some people really want to listen. I found that out the hard way	My background is rather unusual. In 2014, I went from group homes to a town of wealthy individuals when I moved in with my great aunt Joan, the woman I call my mother, at 16.  Coming from bars on the window, I went to a private high school with students with some of the biggest houses I’ve ever seen. From group homes to galas, needless to say, I felt out of place. 
MAY22	Theresa May has turned 10 Downing Street into her own private panic room	Britain. 6pm. Wednesday 22 May 2019. On the night before nationwide European elections that were not meant to happen, Theresa May has turned 10 Downing Street into her own private panic room and Nigel Farage is trapped on a bus in Rochester, surrounded by crowds holding milkshakes.  Or is the other way round? Who even knows? Welcome, everyone, to the sunlit uplands. We have made it to the promised land. We have reached the fully post-metaphor stage of Brexit. It is not “like” anything. Nothing so farcical has occurred before or will again. Not until tomorrow, anyway.
MAY22	If Alabama is serious about being pro-life, it should air the banned Arthur gay marriage episode	PBS show Arthur opened their 22nd season recently with a significant new storyline. Arthur’s teacher Mr Ratburn was featured marrying a “very special person”, who happened to be his male partner.  For the LGBTQIA community, this was a clear win. But for some parts of America, defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory. The state of Alabama is refusing to air the episode, ostensibly on the grounds of "child protection".
MAY22	A military dictatorship in Thailand is clinging onto power – with the tacit support of the western powers	Thailand held its long-delayed general election two months ago, the first since the military dictatorship seized power in a coup by ousting the elected government five years ago. This election was supposed to mark the Kingdom’s return to democracy. Dozens of new parties rushed to register, all seeking to court the votes of millions of Thais, including many first-time voters. For the international community, the election constituted an important step towards a return to civilian rule. Based on the junta’s promise to deliver free and fair elections, the European Union had even decided to resume political contact “at all levels” with Thailand in 2017.
MAY22	Oxford University's measures to help disadvantaged students don't go nearly far enough	The University of Oxford has become the latest higher education institute to attempt to remedy its eltisit reputation, by announcing plans to provide places to talented school-leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds who lack the required grades. It is promising that by 2023, one in four undergraduates will be from the UK’s most underrepresented backgrounds, with the University implementing this drastic change via two new access schemes: Opportunity Oxford and Foundation Oxford. These include initiatives such as a free year of study for financially-challenged students, and a residential study programme for school-leavers who require additional support.
MAY22	As the robots arrive, working people are losing hope – it’s time for the state to step in	We are living in an age of surveillance capitalism where technology is used to turn our daily lives into data sources to line the pockets of CEOs in Silicon Valley. Whereas once the big money makers were industrialists and manufacturers, now the big winners are the data giants who harvest our every click, like and share and sell the information to advertisers.
MAY22	We can’t fight the far right with milkshakes. We can only deal them a defeat at the ballot box	This Thursday, people across the country will vote in the European parliament elections. Historically, the turnout at such elections is low compared to local and general elections. In fact last time they were held, only 35 per cent of eligible voters even bothered with them. However, this year is different.
MAY22	We built an algorithm to track bots during the European elections – what we found should scare you	Computer programmes aren’t going to drag the pencil out of your hand and scrawl an X on the ballot paper for you, but they are doing everything they can to make sure you head to the polling station with a warped idea of popular politics. And by a large majority, it is the right wing of politics that is doing the warping. Using a programme we developed to study bot interference in elections, we found that some 12 per cent of tweets using hashtags promoted by far-right EU parties came from users which showed tell-tale signs of full automation. That is double the average across all parties.
MAY22	I'm standing to be an MEP because it's time to look past Farage the false idol and build a genuine global Britain	Like me, you are probably dismayed at the paralysis with the Brexit negotiations. The people voted to leave and honour that we must. And yet the MPs in the House of Commons have sadly blocked the deal. Now Labour and the Lib Dems are seeking to reverse the majority view. I am standing in this election for the Conservatives because we are the only party that can deliver Brexit and then get on with creating what this new direction for our country was always meant to be about. It is about creating a rejuvenated, global Britain. A country that puts free trade, enterprise and an entrepreneurial spirit at the heart of our British identity. 
MAY22	Game of Thrones tapped into fears of revolution and political women – and left us no better off than before	The last season of the Game of Thrones has prompted public outcry and culminated in a petition (signed by almost 1 million outraged viewers) to disqualify the entire season and re-shoot a new one. The ferocity of the debate is in itself a proof that the ideological stakes must be high. The dissatisfaction turned on a couple of points: bad scenario (under the pressure to quickly end the series, the complexity of the narrative was simplified), bad psychology (Daenerys’ turn to “Mad Queen” was not justified by her character development), etc.
MAY23	If Trump is right, he has temper tantrums. If Nancy Pelosi is right, he pretends to have temper tantrums. Neither is acceptable	"I have a winning temperament. She has a bad temperament,” Donald Trump said in 2016 on the campaign trail. But for someone with such a good temperament, the President of the United States sure has a lot of temper tantrums.  Whenever anyone says something he doesn’t like, he proceeds to meltdown — often on Twitter but sometimes during a press events, including during an apparently impromptu presser yesterday in the White House’s rose garden. Shouldn’t the “leader of the free world” try to keep it together?  Yesterday the President did a lot of wacky stuff. He stormed out of an infrastructure meeting with Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats after three minutes, but not before saying that he wouldn’t legislate until the investigations into his presidency ended.  He then wandered into the rose garden for an “unplanned presser” where he stood at a podium that somehow featured anti-Mueller graphics including the usual “no collusion, no obstruction” in big blue type and said the following: “Instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that have just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.” 
MAY23	When you're a young black Republican being loud on the internet, some people really want to listen. I found that out the hard way	My background is rather unusual. In 2014, I went from group homes to a town of wealthy individuals when I moved in with my great aunt Joan, the woman I call my mother, at 16.  Coming from bars on the window, I went to a private high school with students with some of the biggest houses I’ve ever seen. From group homes to galas, needless to say, I felt out of place. 
MAY23	Brexit pits young against old through the corruption of ‘traditional values’. But there is a way to reverse the damage	Way back in 2012, during the first Avengers movie, Captain America is discussing his new uniform with Agent Phil Coulson. "Aren't the stars and stripes a little old fashioned?" he asks.
MAY23	Bad A-Level choices are blocking poorer kids from uni –  so the Russell Group is going to step in and help	Some people just know what they want to be when they grow up. I watched Open University science programmes on Sunday mornings and wanted to uncover the mysteries of the earth. I duly took A Levels in Chemistry, Maths and Geology before studying the latter at degree level and for my PhD. The educational path for me was clear, at least for the early part of my career. Many young people, however, are less sure. Should they focus on the subjects they enjoy, or those they are told will lead to the best jobs? Should they specialise in sciences, arts or humanities, or spread their bets? Their parents will know the anxiety of trying to provide sound advice.
MAY23	These European elections are a chance for the progressive parties to recapture lost ground	For a set of elections that were never supposed to happen, the selection of the new British members of the European Parliament has assumed an unprecedented importance. Ever since direct elections to the then European Assembly were inaugurated in 1979, these contests have rarely drawn much of a turnout or much excitement, especially in Britain. Now, for the first time – and not a little ironically – the turnout in Britain may be higher than the EU average. Certainly they are the centre of national attention.
MAY23	Probation services are failing thanks – once again – to none other than Chris Grayling	As if there was not enough going awry in Britain’s troubled criminal justice system, HM Inspectorate of Probation now reports that changes to the probation system over the past five years have locked offenders – and taxpayers – “in an expensive merry-go-round” with “no tangible reduction to re-offending”. Predictably, the fault lies with the reforms Chris Grayling implemented during his spell as Lord Chancellor and secretary of state for justice.
MAY23	I used to work for Cambridge Analytica – believe it or not, data can be used for good in politics	I worked as managing director of the non-US political division of Cambridge Analytica for two years until 2018. The company’s well-documented closure signalled a huge shift in the way we think about, and use, data. But a handful of my colleagues and I believed then, as we do now, that data-driven insight is no longer optional. That means it should be as much a tool for progressive politics as for division. A year later, and the UK is once again heading to the polls. We should be getting quite good at it, given that we have just had local elections, it’s less than two years since our last general election and less than three since the Brexit referendum.
MAY23	Political reality has made the Lib Dems the Remain party, and brought a new Brexit referendum closer	What do commentator Matthew Parris, former head of the civil service Lord Gus O’Donnell and actor, LGBT rights activist and Labour peer Michael Cashman have in common? Yesterday, they all came out in support of the Liberal Democrats. They were joined, incidentally, by the Evening Standard (editor one George Osborne). This represents a remarkable resurgence for the Liberal Democrats. Across the spectrum there is a recognition that if the Brexit Party is your foe, the Liberal Democrats are your friend. In the EU elections today we are clearly the strongest voice for those who feel their home lies in the European family. This is reflected in the magnanimous and thoughtful suggestion of Heidi Allen, interim leader of Change UK, that supporters of her party should consider voting Liberal Democrat as the strongest challengers to Nigel Farage.
MAY23	The withdrawal bill vanished, and with it so did the prime minister	The Thursday morning statement about what’s on the parliamentary agenda for the week ahead is the traditional lowlight of the parliamentary calendar. The job of leader of the House of Commons is given to someone who has failed to live up to low expectations and is being very politely ushered out of the cabinet. Not so long ago, Chris Grayling was put out to pasture there, having ruined the justice department. In normal times, you don’t then get to go and ruin another department. These are not normal times. And, in normal times, the Commons does not find itself without a leader because the holder of the lowest job in the cabinet has been the one to deliver the fatal blow in a prime ministerial coup.
MAY23	A new prime minister will not solve the Brexit deadlock – without a new referendum	As the nation voted in the European elections, the Conservative Party turned to the question in which it is most deeply interested: who will be the next prime minister and when?  Theresa May, in the twilight of her office, sent a government whip, Mark Spencer, to the House of Commons today to announce a delay to the withdrawal agreement bill. For “delay” read “end”. The cabinet had made it clear that it could not support this device for asking parliament to vote for a fourth time on her Brexit deal. 
MAY24	Farewell then Ms Maybot, you were almost human after all	“Boris has negotiated in Europe. I seem to remember last time he did a deal with the Germans, he came back with three nearly new water cannon.” A great joke that, and well delivered too, by a woman looking decidedly happy with her lot in life, comfortable in a tartan Vivienne Westwood trouser suit and comfortable in her own skin. Two weeks later she became prime minister, and was never seen or heard from again.
MAY24	Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to call for impeachment because she has a very long list of super important things to do	Despite many calls from the Democratic caucus and Republican Congressman Justin Amash tweeting a case for impeachment, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi remains resistant to the prospect. It’s not that she doesn’t think there’s a case for impeachment - there clearly is. It’s just that Nancy has other priorities - legislative and otherwise - that mean filing articles of impeachment is on the backburner.  What could take priority over impeachment? Turns out that Nancy has quite a long list:

MAY24	Banning plastic straws and cotton buds is great – but we’re still burning recyclables at an alarming rate	Of course it’s excellent news that single use stirrers, cotton buds etc will be banned from 2020 (Plastic straws and cotton buds to be banned next year in effort to tackle plastic pollution, 22 May). But can we now move on to halting the incineration of the plastic we continue to use?
MAY24	Theresa May is gone – and Britain is now at the mercy of a small band of barmy Tory members	There are many people you entrust with your life, vital interests and future. Surgeons. Airline pilots. Financial advisers. Bosses. How about 124,000 slightly dotty members of the Conservative Party, that stout body of patriotic men and women of famously considered judgement, moderate views and willingness always to “see the other side” of an argument? Especially when it comes to Britain’s future in Europe. That’s 124,000 out of the 47 million or so people that comprise the British electorate – about a quarter of 1 per cent. One in 400 of us will have any say in the election of a new PM at a crucial moment in our island’s story. Some democracy. Now we know what “taking back control” means. Yes, control of the country by a minute Tory clique.
MAY24	Live venues deliver thrills like nothing else, so why are you stuck there looking at YouTube?	This morning, political journalists, who’ve spent the last few months incessantly predicting Theresa May’s imminent resignation like 11-year-olds at a traffic light, summoned one last “nnnnnnnow!” and threw up their fists in celebration. I have been engaged in my own long-running and determined campaign of refusing to write a column about Brexit. You’re quite welcome.  Instead, I’d like to write about something a bit more hopeful: awakenings. Can you point to one moment that fuelled and propelled you towards your dreams? I have two.
MAY24	Trump says he feels sorry for Theresa May - but his friends are about to take over Britain	Theresa May is the only British prime minister Donald Trump has had any kind of relationship with – perhaps even that fabled “special relationship” we were led to believe should exist between Britain and the US.  The unappealing pair have had their ups, downs and more downs over the last two years. 
MAY24	May’s time is over – but Brexit hasn’t claimed its last casualty yet	As in the final scene of a Shakespearean tragedy, there are tears, blood on the walls and bodies litter the stage. Some 35 ministers have quit during the short premiership of Theresa May, the last being Andrea Leadsom with her opportunistic stiletto between the prime minister’s shoulder blades. She was, to borrow a phrase, a dead woman walking by then in any case. Now the prime minister herself has, in effect, been pushed onto the tottering Tory funeral pyre. Outside Westminster, strewn across the electoral battlefield lie the remains of a Tory party being routed across the country – another 1,300 defeated councillors, scores of Conservative MEPs trounced by the pincer movement of Nigel Farage to the right and Vince Cable to the centre. Many Conservative constituency associations, once part of the warp and weft of life in rural and suburban Britain exist on paper only.
MAY25	We can't turn our back on democracy just because an ultra-hard Brexiteer might be entering No 10	Brexit has threatened everything from our economy to our sanity: now it is coming for British parliamentary democracy. Increasingly, the private talk among Brexit ultras is that once Boris Johnson or some even more blood-curdling alternative is installed as leader, the Conservatives will prorogue parliament – that is, prevent MPs from meeting in the Commons – so parliament can’t stop Britain crashing out of the EU.
MAY25	Theresa May’s legacy is the hostile environment – how can she evoke Nicholas Winton in her resignation speech?	It was stirring that in her resignation speech Theresa May paid tribute to Sir Nicholas Winton, our very own “British Schindler” who rescued hundreds of child refugees from the Nazis. But it was also galling. Because if there is one thing May will be remembered for beyond Brexit, it is the toxic “hostile environment” that destroyed the lives and families of so many migrants up and down this country. As the longest serving home secretary in modern times, May fought doggedly to stop child refugees reaching our shores from Europe. Invoking Sir Nicholas during her valedictory address was therefore “quite wrong, and a bit of an abuse”, as our patron Lord Dubs, who was saved himself by Sir Nicholas’ kindertransport operation, points out.
MAY25	The Top 10: Songs About Rain by Scottish Bands	This list was suggested by Chris Hanretty three years ago. It is now mature and ready to go. Here they are, in chronological order. 1. “Another Rainy Day In New York City”, Bay City Rollers, 1976. Thanks to Joe Ainsworth and Teri Walsh.
MAY25	These European elections are a chance for the progressive parties to recapture lost ground	For a set of elections that were never supposed to happen, the selection of the new British members of the European Parliament has assumed an unprecedented importance. Ever since direct elections to the then European Assembly were inaugurated in 1979, these contests have rarely drawn much of a turnout or much excitement, especially in Britain.

Predictably, the fault lies with the reforms Chris Grayling implemented during his spell as Lord Chancellor and secretary of state for justice.
MAY25	Mea culpa: the phantom menace of horse-based metaphors	Many of my opinions are unpopular. Tony Blair was on balance a good prime minister. David Cameron was quite right to hold a referendum on Europe. All skyscrapers in London are wonderful apart from the “Walkie-Talkie”.  But there is one opinion that is less popular than the others. It is that The Phantom Menace is the best Star Wars film. So I did not agree with the starting point of our look back to the film’s launch, 20 years ago, at which the headline subtly hinted: “Disaster of the universe”. 
MAY25	The three big lies we were told that led to Brexit, the most damaging lie of all	In 1999, the EU elections were dominated by Labour and the Conservatives, with Ukip getting little more than 6 per cent of the vote. It was the second year of a Labour government that would bring us a decade of economic and political stability – until the global financial crisis. Fast forward to today. Recent opinion polls give the Brexit party over 30 per cent of the vote for the European elections, a party with no members and Nigel Farage being the only recognisable person in it. Government business has ground to a halt because of Brexit and the withdrawal bill has still not been passed by parliament.
MAY25	Banning cotton buds? Michael Gove, stop trying to make us feel guilty and take real action on climate change instead	The climate crisis is becoming mainstream. In an astonishing turn, Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes led by Swedish student Greta Thunberg cut through the Brexit despair and forced parliament to declare a climate emergency. Just this week Michael Gove, environment secretary, announced that by 2020 all plastic straws, plastic stirrers and cotton buds would be banned in England, aside for medical purposes. This policy, he declared, would “ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.”
MAY25	Brexit has never been about EU membership. It's always been about money and political power	I have, since 2016, been an avid (some would say, obsessive) observer of the whole Brexit debacle, and have come to thoroughly despise the attitude of the two main parties. They remind me of nothing more than two giant battling male elephant seals – in their struggle for dominance, utterly heedless of the females and babies crushed under their lumbering bulk. Farage, like some opportunistic beta male, is shoving his way into the fray in the hope of a little action, equally uncaring of the fate of the rest of the herd.
MAY25	Boris Johnson needs to be honest in responding to the backlash against a no-deal Brexit	Within hours of the prime minister announcing her resignation, Boris Johnson both consolidated his position as the frontrunner to succeed her and provoked a backlash against him. His words in Switzerland yesterday, promising that, if he were prime minister, the UK would leave the European Union on 31 October, “deal or no deal”, were met with a sharp reaction from three cabinet ministers today. 
MAY26	Matteo Salvini is spearheading an ultra-right alliance to cause havoc across the EU	Last weekend Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, gathered representatives from 11 other European far-right parties for a rally in Milan. It was watched by as many as 25,000 people. “We must secure the future of our land and children,” said Geert Wilders, the populist anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim politician from the Netherlands. Worryingly, his language appeared to mimic the infamous white supremacist phrase, the 14 words.
MAY26	What the loss of my mum taught me about the burden of care on young women	One of the most important things that losing my mum has taught me is that the burden of care falls to women and girls. My mum died of ovarian cancer 10 years ago, when I was 11. So, in my teens, I took on a different role in my family than most of my peers who still had their mums. After she passed, I found that I gradually began to shoulder more responsibility for looking after elderly relatives, including my grandmother, and negotiating family dynamics. I know that if my mum were alive, the responsibility would have fallen to her. I feel I have inherited the role of caregiver, where my brothers did not. The burden of care refers to the physical, emotional, social and financial problems experienced by caregivers. For me, this burden mainly surrounded physical and emotional tasks.
MAY26	Emily Thornberry has blown Labour’s split wide open	Just before the first result came in from the North East region, Emily Thornberry announced a split in the Labour Party live on air. She is not just shadow foreign secretary, but Jeremy Corbyn’s other deputy, the one who stands in for him at Prime Minister’s Questions. She admitted that her party had done badly in the elections and explained why. “We were not clear on the one single thing people wanted to hear. We should have said quite simply that any deal that comes out of this government should be put to a confirmatory referendum; that Remain should be on the ballot paper; and that Labour would campaign to Remain.”
MAY26	British publishing still has a massive problem with diversity and it's not good enough	For a while, it looked like the massive lack of diversity within publishing was finally being taken seriously. The last 12 months in particular has seen an influx of books written by black women and based on black women narratives. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl’s Bible, Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging and Queenie are some of the most popular examples. Major publishing houses, including Faber and Faber and Hachette UK, also launched programmes to seek out talented Bame individuals, offering workshops, internships and networking opportunities.

Ever since direct elections to the then European Assembly were inaugurated in 1979, these contests have rarely drawn much of a turnout or much excitement, especially in Britain. Now, for the first time – and not a little ironically – the turnout in Britain may be higher than the EU average. Certainly they are the centre of national attention.
MAY26	The Top 10: Songs About Rain by Scottish Bands	This list was suggested by Chris Hanretty three years ago. It is now mature and ready to go. Here they are, in chronological order. 1. “Another Rainy Day In New York City”, Bay City Rollers, 1976. Thanks to Joe Ainsworth and Teri Walsh.
MAY26	I wrote about my mental health and it cost me my job	In retrospect, I can accept that I’ve struggled with my mental health since my teenage years. However, I was too wrapped up in my particular brand of toxic masculinity to talk about it at the time with my parents. Being angry towards other people on the street made me feel better about myself, masking my anxiety and sadness. I stumbled into adulthood doing way too many of the things people do to feel good, to numb the fact I often felt awful. I found direction and purpose through my work in education, but spending nearly a decade absorbing the trauma our children live with was taking its toll on me.
MAY26	We can't turn our back on democracy just because an ultra-hard Brexiteer might be entering No 10	Brexit has threatened everything from our economy to our sanity: now it is coming for British parliamentary democracy. Increasingly, the private talk among Brexit ultras is that once Boris Johnson or some even more blood-curdling alternative is installed as leader, the Conservatives will prorogue parliament – that is, prevent MPs from meeting in the Commons – so parliament can’t stop Britain crashing out of the EU.
MAY26	Whatever way I vote in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon will claim it’s a vote for independence	With the SNP expected to win half of Scotland’s seats in the recent EU election, they will undoubtedly use this as more evidence to support their spurious and democratically refuted claim that Scotland yearns to be independent. However, we have reached the point where it no longer matters. If I choose not to vote it will be used to support independence as it demonstrates my apathy with the current system – the one based in London of course; it’s never a statement on the SNP-led Holyrood. If there’s a low turnout, people are fed up with Westminster and only in an independent Scotland can democracy be revitalised. If I vote for another party, even a unionist one, I really want independence, I just didn’t know it.
MAY26	An obstinate Leaver who wants to defy democracy or a ‘continuity candidate’? There is no good choice in this contest	To listen to some of the candidates standing for the leadership of the Conservative Party and to become the next prime minister, you would think they were about to inherit a crushing parliamentary majority and a united cabinet. From their breezy optimism about renegotiating the EU withdrawal agreement, you would imagine the European Union is about to cave in to their demands. You are also asked to believe that a no-deal Brexit is nothing to be especially fearful about, and that substantial tax cuts can easily be afforded. It is a world where disastrous local and European election results can be shrugged off.  Either they are deluded or they are trying cynically to appeal to the 160,000 Eurosceptic Tory members who will end up choosing Britain’s next prime minister. It is a depressing scene.
MAY27	Nicola Sturgeon will see the European election results as a clear message for another Scottish referendum	If the EU parliamentary election results are anything to go by, the UK’s Brexit divisions are not going to heal any time soon. This should be unsurprising given that, five years on from Scotland’s independence referendum, the Scottish electorate remains firmly divided on its future within the UK. Last Thursday, 45 per cent of Scottish voters backed pro-independence parties – the SNP and the Scottish Greens – whereas the unionist parties tallied 55 per cent, mirroring 2014’s referendum result. After more than a decade in government in Holyrood, the SNP soared to 38 per cent, polling 23 points ahead of their nearest rivals and earning more votes than the Scottish Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Labour combined.
MAY27	Nigel Farage’s success is good news for one reason. He has killed off those who are even loonier than him	It comes to something when one of the few encouraging developments in British politics is that a chap styling himself as Sargon of Akkad will not be representing the people of South West England in the European parliament. You can imagine the bemused Belgian TV reporters trying to make sense of that guy, like something out of Monty Python but with added hate.  Real name Carl Benjamin, Sargs is the Ukip candidate who thinks cracking gags about rape and threatening violence on Jess Phillips MP is funny – a “free speech merchant” according to his leader, Gerard Batten. Electing Benjamin, though, was to be just too embarrassing for the voters. Instead, they plumped for the Brexit Party’s Ann Widdecombe, who is also an embarrassment, and whose views on LGBT+ issues are, shall we say, disappointing. But at least she doesn’t threaten violence. (Can you imagine?)
MAY27	British publishing still has a massive problem with diversity and it's not good enough	For a while, it looked like the massive lack of diversity within publishing was finally being taken seriously. The last 12 months in particular has seen an influx of books written by black women and based on black women narratives. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl’s Bible, Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging and Queenie are some of the most popular examples. Major publishing houses, including Faber and Faber and Hachette UK, also launched programmes to seek out talented Bame individuals, offering workshops, internships and networking opportunities.

MAY27	Banning plastic straws and cotton buds is great – but we’re still burning recyclables at an alarming rate	Of course it’s excellent news that single use stirrers, cotton buds etc will be banned from 2020 (Plastic straws and cotton buds to be banned next year in effort to tackle plastic pollution, 22 May). But can we now move on to halting the incineration of the plastic we continue to use?
MAY27	Mea culpa: the phantom menace of horse-based metaphors	Many of my opinions are unpopular. Tony Blair was on balance a good prime minister. David Cameron was quite right to hold a referendum on Europe. All skyscrapers in London are wonderful apart from the “Walkie-Talkie”.  But there is one opinion that is less popular than the others. It is that The Phantom Menace is the best Star Wars film. So I did not agree with the starting point of our look back to the film’s launch, 20 years ago, at which the headline subtly hinted: “Disaster of the universe”. 
MAY27	As a young voter, I’d always gone with Labour. Not this time	“You can tell which wing of the Labour Party someone is from, whether they’re voting for the Liberal Democrats or the Greens on Thursday.” So said a tweet late last week, from a longtime Labour friend of mine. 
MAY27	The centre is dead. When will the left wake up and speak with one voice like the far right?	As Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini, Geert Wilders and other far-right leaders concluded their European electoral campaign in a joint rally in Milan, they hailed the dawn of a “peaceful revolution” in Europe. Puccini’s aria, Nessun Dorma, and its refrain of “Vincerò’ (I shall win), filled Milan’s Piazza del Duomo. They did not win, or at least the advances were not as significant as expected, in the European elections. But the results in France, Italy, and also the UK show that the far right have succeeded in something arguably more lasting: shaping a common nativist vision of a Europe that is neither purely reactive nor purely nostalgic. In Milan, the far right spoke with one voice. It vowed to defend the true Europe, a Europe of peoples rather than oligarchic neoliberal elites. The electoral campaign insisted immigration and Islam were shared threats, and evoked Leonardo da Vinci and Jeanne d’Arc as a vision for defending the victims of austerity against the Brussels elites.
MAY27	The European elections show the people are just as divided as parliament – the only way out of Brexit deadlock is a new referendum	The winners of the European elections were the Remain alliance – which is what Chuka Umunna, of the new Change UK party, once tried to call the five parties committed to keeping Britain in the EU. Between them, the Liberal Democrats, Greens, Scottish National Party, Change UK and Plaid Cymru won 40 per cent of the vote.
MAY27	As a newly-elected Green MEP, I'm excited to start working on our own version of the Green New Deal	Last night a green wave swept across Europe. Almost 70 Green MEPs were elected, with huge surges of support in Germany, France, Ireland, and Finland. In the UK the Green Party won a record seven seats – more than doubling our best tally in a European election. This election took place at a time when concern for the environment was at a historic high. After years of struggle from environmental groups, the last few months have seen a combination of school students on strike, David Attenborough’s shocking documentaries, Greta Thunberg’s activism and Extinction Rebellion’s protests – and all of a sudden the fate of our planet flew to the top of the news agenda. Those of us entering the European Parliament as new Green MEPs do so as part of a social movement sweeping the globe.
MAY28	As an American lawyer, I don't want to see Julian Assange extradited to my country	Julian Assange was indicted last week for 17 violations of the Espionage Act of 1917.  The Espionage Act makes it a crime “to convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States.”  He faces up to 340 years in prison. You don’t have to like Julian Assange’s politics or his personality to understand that if he is extradited to the United States, not only does he face a de facto life sentence, but every journalist who receives and publishes classified information faces such jeopardy as well.  As the Knight First Amendment Institute tweeted, “The government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”  
MAY28	Six months after the death of my father Harry Leslie Smith, I read the European election results with sadness	This week, the world’s oldest rebel and my dad Harry Leslie Smith will have been dead six months. To me, it feels like only six minutes have past since he stopped breathing. His shirts still hang in his bedroom closet while the book he was reading before he was rushed to hospital sits on a table beside his favourite chair.    Since he died, the singularity of my existence spreads out towards me like the ocean tide at night. When I eat my dinner, in silence, the television as my companion, with the detritus of our life together scattered around the living room in the apartment we once shared, I become acutely aware of the hole my father’s death has torn open in my own existence. 
MAY28	What I've learnt as an atheist from dating a devout Christian	I'm an atheist. I have been for as long as I can remember. All my closest friends are atheists. We do atheist things like fear death and worry about the meaninglessness of life. Then, about a year ago, something quite unexpected happened: I fell in love with a Christian. A proper one, too. For her, God is as certain as daybreak and nightfall.  In the beginning (to quote a certain book) there were debates. Lots of debates. I made the usual arguments from the atheist corner; she countered from the Christian camp. She thought I was naive; I thought she was delusional. We butted heads and it soon became boring because this was all happening in the first few months of the relationship, the time when you fall madly and completely in love with someone.
MAY28	The UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees is almost out of cash – does anyone care?	This time next month the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) will be out of cash. I’m not sure many people understand or care. But if this happens, a million Palestinians will go without food, schools across Gaza and the West Bank will close, vaccination clinics will halt, and as many as 1,700 people could have their limbs amputated. The UN, the second largest employer in Gaza, will have to slash jobs, driving up unemployment when it’s already the highest in the world.
MAY28	Banning plastic straws and cotton buds is great – but we’re still burning recyclables at an alarming rate	Of course it’s excellent news that single use stirrers, cotton buds etc will be banned from 2020 (Plastic straws and cotton buds to be banned next year in effort to tackle plastic pollution, 22 May). But can we now move on to halting the incineration of the plastic we continue to use?

MAY28	NHS doctors like me are working for free just to stay afloat. The government is exploiting our professionalism	"Headline it for me." As a GP, this is a stock phrase I use if you come in to my surgery and say you have four problems to discuss. At least you have given me a heads up that there are four problems, but now I want a list of one-word titles so I can judge what I can manage in the time.  Literally everyone expresses amazement when I reveal appointments are scheduled to last 10 minutes only. Apparently, this is a very well-kept NHS secret. I can talk to you about anything you like for 10 minutes: hair loss, mood problems, toe nails…. If you walk in with a limp, or a red eye then I know early on what we are going to be talking about. Sometimes I am kept in breathless suspense: "I’ve had this problem for more than two weeks, and I’m really worried about it as it’s so painful, my mum said I should definitely come and talk to you about it…" So what is it? What are we talking about? It could be anywhere in the body until the roulette ball falls.
MAY28	Uefa has dropped the ball over the Baku final	Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, is a long way to go for a London derby. Hence the many complaints from football fans about the cost in time and money of travelling 2,900 miles to the steppes of central Asia to watch Arsenal play Chelsea in the Europa League final. Valid, or at least understandable, as some of the objections about the venue may be, they fail to take account of the fact that this isn’t any old FA Cup tie or Premier League game, but the final of a European tournament. It is unusual for both finalists to come from one country, let alone the same city.
MAY28	We have come together across party lines to demand a vote on Brexit – why can’t MPs do the same?	Dear all parliamentarians, We, the undersigned, are the representatives of young activists from across the political spectrum. 
MAY28	Corbyn is right. Labour must force a general election to unite Leavers and Remainers against austerity	Brexit is not a crisis of Jeremy Corbyn’s making. It was David Cameron who called the referendum; the aftermath of which has brought political chaos to the country. And it is him who is relaxing in his countryside manor as the nation tears itself apart. Yet many progressive Remainers believe that it should be down to Corbyn’s Labour to block the Brexit that Cameron’s overreaching hubris created. But Corbyn has always valued the democratic voice of ordinary people, and was therefore right to have accepted the result of the referendum after 52 per cent of the country voted Leave, including at least 35 per cent of Labour voters. But Labour’s strategy has never been to give the Tories a free-hand when it comes to Brexit. 
MAY29	Mueller just told the world Trump is a criminal. Now congress must impeach him	So there we have it: Robert Mueller went out in the style to which we have become accustomed – saying very little in public and being as professional as he can. But the fact Mueller felt he needed to do those eight minutes behind the podium at all shows how he believes the words of his report have been twisted by the administration of Donald Trump.
MAY29	Yes, Labour members can criticise Israel without being antisemitic – Clare Short has spread a poisonous myth	Clare Short is helping to spread a myth that stops the Labour Party from getting to grips with antisemitism. The former Labour cabinet minister claimed on Newsnight on Tuesday that the real problem was not antisemitism but the stretching of the definition of antisemitism to include all “criticism of Israel”. David Hirsh, author of Contemporary Left Antisemitism, coined the term “the Livingstone Formulation” to sum up what is going on when someone spreads the “you can’t criticise Israel” myth. He named it after Ken Livingstone who once said: “The accusation of antisemitism has been used against anyone who is critical of the policies of the Israeli government.” (Any person, any criticism, note.)
MAY29	For decades we have ignored the stories of the Polish Windrush Generation – now it's time to listen	Since the Windrush scandal caused mass outrage last year, much has been said about the appalling ways in which the government treated a whole class of citizens, but little effort is made to really consider the nuances of what the “generation” means. Consider, for example, the Polish presence – a whole contingent of Windrush arrivalswho are rarely represented when discussing these issues.  There were 66 Polish refugees on board the Empire Windrush on its now historic passage from the Caribbean to England. After the ship departed Kingston, Jamaica, it detoured to Tampico, a port on the coast of Mexico, to collect the Polish passengers. They had been displaced in Mexico since 1944.  
MAY29	The shortage of nurses could have dire consequences – just ask those of us who see it every day	It’s worrying to hear that two-thirds of nurses feel that they are struggling to provide good care to patients who are dying as a result of staff shortages, as Marie Curie has warned today. Sadly, to those of us in the profession, this comes as no surprise. Too many nurses find themselves pushed from pillar to post, trying to make sure patients are comfortable but unable to go the extra mile due to increasingly heavy workloads. 
MAY29	John Bercow is the best bet we’ve got to protect the sovereignty of parliament and the people	Probably the best reason to keep John Bercow on as speaker of the House of Commons is that, politics being what they are these days, our MPs probably couldn’t be relied upon to choose a successor.  This is more than a quip. As we discovered with the “indicative votes” on Brexit, the Commons works on a process of motions and amendments, and this is what has been used over the decades, if not centuries, to elect a series of speakers. The MPs do not vote via a conventional ballot paper for the different personalities on offer, but through amendments to a motion. It is not entirely satisfactory, but hasn’t caused great trouble in the past. It might now.
MAY29	Despite being innocent, Asia Bibi was forced out of her country – this is the dark truth about Pakistan's blasphemy laws	Asia Bibi, the Christian woman who was acquitted by Pakistan’s Supreme Court in a blasphemy case last year, left the country of her birth earlier this month to seek refuge in Canada, where she has been reunited with her family. Bibi was ultimately acquitted of blasphemy charges only after spending nine years in jail on death row following a previous guilty ruling. The decision of the Supreme Court sparked country-wide protests by hardline religious-political groups, raising fears for Bibi’s safety.
MAY29	John Cleese's latest xenophobic comments reveal a sad truth about aging comedians	This week, former funnyman John Cleese took to social media to inveigh, in his usual adorable, puckish manner, against the curse of multiculturalism with which London finds itself shockingly beset.  “Some years ago I opined”, wrote the erstwhile comedian, “that London was not really an English city any more. Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation. So there must be some truth in it… I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.”
MAY29	‘Love Island’ is barely worth watching as it is – but don't worry ITV, I know exactly how to fix it	I am dreading the return of Love Island. I’ll admit I’m not the target demographic for the show, though I’m thinking the audience might include a surprising proportion of old blokes taking an unusual interest in this particular bikini-clad exemplar of reality TV. I can picture them sat there on the sofa in their underpants with only a tube of Pringles and a bottle of White Lightning for company. As far as I can gather, the new contestants, announced to much fanfare yesterday, are yet another lot whose doomed quest for love is more likely to take place on a traffic island than some sunkissed beach in the Med.
MAY29	Boris Johnson’s legal scrape only adds to the fantasy oddness of Brexit	Even by the Alice in Wonderland standards of today, the private prosecution of Boris Johnson for “misconduct in a public office” is strange indeed. The case is being pursued by a campaigner, Marcus Ball, who has crowdfunded £200,000 for the cause.  A source close to Mr Johnson called the case a “politically motivated attempt to reverse Brexit”. It will be heard at Westminster Magistrates’ Court and then may be referred to a crown court. If it proceeds – and there will be many legal wrangles and challenges along the way – it might see a serving prime minister (that is, Mr Johnson) in the dock answering serious charges. He has denied misconduct in a public office. It is the stuff of a political fiction from Michael Dobbs or Jeffrey Archer.
MAY29	Boris Johnson vs Michael Gove will be the most spectacular political battle in years	“We’re looking at our next prime minister,” one admirer of Jeremy Hunt told me, as we watched the foreign secretary practise his lines for a Tory leadership election. “We have to recognise our job is not just to unite our party but unite the country,” Hunt told a reception for the Onward think tank at last autumn’s Tory conference. He called for “a true Brexit for the 52 per cent but also a generous Brexit for the 48 per cent”. My ears pricked up at that; the latter was something Theresa May never did, to her cost.
MAY30	The final punishment of Julian Assange reminds journalists their job is to uncover what the state keeps hidden	I’m getting a bit tired of the US Espionage Act. For that matter, I’ve been pretty weary of the Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning saga for a long time. No one wants to talk about their personalities because no one seems to like them very much – even those who have benefited journalistically from their revelations.  From the start, I’ve been worried about the effect of Wikileaks, not on the brutal western governments whose activities it has disclosed in shocking detail (especially in the Middle East) but on the practice of journalism. When we scribes were served up this Wikileaks pottage, we jumped in, paddled around and splashed the walls of reporting with our cries of horror. And we forgot that real investigative journalism was about the dogged pursuit of truth through one’s own sources rather than upsetting a bowl of secrets in front of readers, secrets which Assange and co – rather than us – had chosen to make public.
MAY30	Watching Elizabeth Warren debate with Meghan McCain on The View made me realise something about America	Senator Elizabeth Warren walked out to a cheering crowd on The View this morning. Some audience members clapped in enthusiasm while others waved signs to welcome the 2020 presidential candidate, who is currently in third place in the polls behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. “Not everyone gets this reception,” said co-host Sunny Hostin.
MAY30	Like Simon Cowell, I hate homework and so does my son. It's damaging his mental health	Last week my six-year-old son, George, missed his Tuesday evening swimming class because we had homework to finish. Yes, we missed a lesson that he loves – as well as being good for his overall health, it could also save his life one day – so that he could draw a picture of a wombat and write some facts about it in our “learning together” book that has to be completed every term.  The reality, which I’m sure many parents will recognise, was that I drew a wombat and George reluctantly coloured it in. Then he copied a few sentences that I had written for him, which took him the best part of an hour as his writing was interspersed with crying (his) and coaxing (mine) followed by shouting (both of us). If by “learning together” the school means that we are both learning that we hate homework, then it’s a pretty good title.
MAY30	The shortage of nurses could have dire consequences – just ask those of us who see it every day	It’s worrying to hear that two-thirds of nurses feel that they are struggling to provide good care to patients who are dying as a result of staff shortages, as Marie Curie has warned today.

Too many nurses find themselves pushed from pillar to post, trying to make sure patients are comfortable but unable to go the extra mile due to increasingly heavy workloads.

The decision of the Supreme Court sparked country-wide protests by hardline religious-political groups, raising fears for Bibi’s safety.
MAY30	Rory Stewart took opium at a party – but will the Tory leader hopeful see sense on the war on drugs?	Rory Stewart has the makings of a refreshingly straight talking politician; you may remember as prisons minister he asserted that he’d resign if drug use in prisons didn’t decline within a year. Lucky for him his brief changed before the year was up. Now the international development secretary and Tory leader hopeful has confessed to using opium, the substance that produces heroin. Was this a calculated move or a comment he didn’t think would attract the attention it has? It’s unlikely to be a mistake – he’s a canny operator and clearly media savvy.
MAY30	I was told to ‘go home’ because I am a pro-Europe MEP. This torrent of bitter abuse must be stopped	The demonising of “traitors” who disagree? Check. Intimidation and foul-mouthed contempt for opponents? Check. Simplistic answers to complex problems? Check. Whether they like it or not, and despite their activists’ howls of outrage, the Brexit Party’s rapid rise to prominence bears all the hallmarks of far-right movements throughout Europe’s troubled 20th century history. That uncomfortable political baggage tends to follow Nigel Farage wherever he goes – and it’s not a coincidence or a conspiracy. 
MAY30	Theresa May's belated tuition fee pledge is a slap in the face to students	We’ve all been there, haven’t we? With deadline day fast approaching, our university assessments quickly become an exercise in how many words you can write, as opposed to the quality of your work. The Augar Review review of post-18 education and funding in England – all 20,000 words of it – doesn’t have the feel of a slapdash piece of work. But the sheer fact that it’s been rushed out in the dying days of Theresa May’s premiership, like some sort of fig leaf to cover an absence of a domestic agenda for the last three years, does.
MAY30	Pragmatist Philip Hammond knows that only a Final Say can solve Brexit. He should be running for PM	In a saner world than the one the Conservative Party currently calls home, the idea of Philip Hammond as prime minister would be a perfectly plausible one. Though lacking a little charisma, the chancellor of the exchequer has a relatively distinguished ministerial record in high office (unlike some of his rivals), has never voted against his party in the Commons (unlike some of his rivals) and has sensible views on Europe (unlike some of his rivals). Neville Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan and John Major were all former chancellors who went on to lead their party, albeit with varying degrees of success. What makes Mr Hammond, for the time being, an implausible candidate for the leadership are his views on Brexit. These are far too logical and realistic to appeal to many of the Conservative activists who will decide this election, a substantial number of whom would prefer Nigel Farage to any of the current runners. 
MAY31	If Ted Cruz and John Cornyn actually stood up for Texans, they could stop Trump's Mexican trade tariff madness	If Congress had any reason to start an impeachment inquiry, forget about allegations of Russian collusion or obstruction of justice. Trump's never-ending tariff folly on the back of specious national security claims is an abuse of power deserving of drastic measures.  The President’s latest threat of imposing tariffs on all goods imported into the United States from Mexico to address illegal border crossings is a reckless and counterproductive scheme that will help no one and will especially hurt the state of Texas. 
MAY31	Labour is collapsing under the strain of Brexit – and pro-Corbyn MPs are considering life without their leader	Despite the Conservatives’ calamitous fifth place in the European elections and their divisive leadership election, Labour somehow managed to match their bad headlines this week. Its poor third place behind Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats came as a shock to Jeremy Corbyn, who was badly advised by aides about the likely impact of his “all things to all people” approach to Brexit. It is very rare for the two main parties to be in such a mess at the same time. It won’t end while Brexit remains unresolved. A YouGov poll for The Times today puts the re-energised Lib Dems top for the first time in nine years.
MAY31	What use is rape counselling if victims are banned from discussing the reason they're there?	It is widely known that rape victims get a raw deal from the criminal justice system. But a recent Vice investigation has brought to light the extent to which victims' emotional needs post-assault and in the run up to the trial are even more woefully handled than many had believed. I have first-hand experience. In February last year, I reported the man who raped me in 2006 to the police. I was 15 at the time of the rape and tried to push what happened to the back of my mind. It was only when I googled my rapist’s name and discovered he was in prison for committing another sexual offence almost a decade after what he did to me that I finally found the courage to seek justice.
MAY31	America’s persecution of Julian Assange has everything to do with Yemen	I was in Kabul a decade ago when WikiLeaks released a massive tranche of US government documents about the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen. On the day of the release, I was arranging by phone to meet an American official for an unattributable briefing. I told him in the course of our conversation what I had just learned from the news wires. He was intensely interested and asked me what was known about the degree of classification of the files. When I told him, he said in a relieved tone: “No real secrets, then.”
MAY31	Mea Culpa: agnostic – incapable of believing in Boris	In an editorial on Sunday, we said that the EU was “agnostic about who the British premier is”. A reader objected that this implied that our European partners could not be sure about the existence of such an implausible deity.  This appeal was rejected by reference to the Oxford dictionary, which said that, in a non-religious context, agnostic means “having a doubtful or non-committal attitude towards something”.
MAY31	For decades we have ignored the stories of the Polish Windrush Generation – now it's time to listen	Since the Windrush scandal caused mass outrage last year, much has been said about the appalling ways in which the government treated a whole class of citizens, but little effort is made to really consider the nuances of what the “generation” means.

For that matter, I’ve been pretty weary of the Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning saga for a long time. No one wants to talk about their personalities because no one seems to like them very much – even those who have benefited journalistically from their revelations.  From the start, I’ve been worried about the effect of Wikileaks, not on the brutal western governments whose activities it has disclosed in shocking detail (especially in the Middle East) but on the practice of journalism. When we scribes were served up this Wikileaks pottage, we jumped in, paddled around and splashed the walls of reporting with our cries of horror. And we forgot that real investigative journalism was about the dogged pursuit of truth through one’s own sources rather than upsetting a bowl of secrets in front of readers, secrets which Assange and co – rather than us – had chosen to make public.
MAY31	Surely the young people who elected Corbyn as leader now realise that they made a mistake?	It’s time to be honest with ourselves. If the Labour Party had a more moderate leadership it would be poised to rescue us from the horrors of Brexit and a degenerating Tory Party. Instead, it merely represents a different set of horrors, the latest example of which takes the form of NEC member Peter Willsman, who seems to be saying that he thinks the Israeli embassy might be whipping up antisemitism claims with the party.
MAY31	The unwieldy Tory leadership race looks like an exercise in Brexit time-wasting	It is now almost two months since the European Council graciously agreed to the UK’s request for an extension to the Article 50 Brexit deadline. At the time, the president of the council, Donald Tusk, implored this of Britain: “Do not waste this time.” Brexit day was pushed back, again, to 31 October, Halloween. We are about a third of the way through our reprieve. Not much has been done. Though too polite to say so, Mr Tusk may be disappointed by the progress the UK has made in determining a way forward for Brexit. Instead, it seems like the British are showing clear signs of displacement activity.
MAY31	Antisemitism is on the rise again across Europe – both the far-right and far-left are to blame	For all the talk of a Brexit Party revolution, a Green emergence, and the sweeping rise of populists across Europe, one story seems to have dipped very slightly under the radar. In Germany, Jewish men and boys have been instructed by a government official not to wear a traditional kippah, or skullcap, in public, to reduce the chance of falling victim to abuse or attack.  In the UK, meanwhile, the expulsion from the Labour Party of Alistair Campbell for declaring he had voted Liberal Democrat in the EU elections clouded over the news that the party will be formally investigated by the UK Equalities and Human Rights Commission. The equalities watchdog will investigate whether the party has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish.
JUN1	No Labour grandee is above the rules of the party – Alastair Campbell had to go	Don’t be deceived: Alastair Campbell knew exactly what he was doing when he publicly declared his support for an opposition party, not least the party that propped up cruel Tory austerity and supported benefit cuts in exchange for a 5p plastic bag charge when in coalition. Despite his statement that he is “and always will be Labour”, he did vote Liberal Democrat and the Labour Party rulebook (chapter 2 paragraph 4, to be precise) clearly states that members who support a party other than Labour are automatically ineligible for membership.
JUN1	I’m no pushover with pampered kids – but labelling struggling children ‘snowflakes’ needs to stop	I’ll surprise nobody by saying that the media is full of “snowflake” chatter of late. The Daily Star was called out by mental health campaigners for its recent headlines including “Snowflake kids get lessons in chilling” – a piece about how children are being taught mindfulness techniques in schools – and I’m sure I don’t need to mention which infamous breakfast presenter is a strong supporter of this type of labelling; often causing lots of emotional reactions from viewers who love to hate him. These headlines create controversy but, sadly, that’s not all they’re responsible for.
JUN1	The violence, gambling techniques and worker exploitation behind the world’s favourite video games	The history of video games goes back to the 1950s, but many still see them as a niche activity that happens behind closed doors. Over this time, video games have grown into a global industry that has reshaped how we think about play and work. In the UK, it has been reported that consumers spend more on video games than either film or music. In 2018, the figure stood at £3.86bn, a jump of 9.1 per cent from the previous year. Video games are, in terms of spending at least, now a mainstream activity.
JUN1	The Top 10: Political walkouts	This list was suggested by Tom Harris, after Tom Watson walked out of the shadow cabinet meeting before the European elections when he was told no copy of the manifesto, with its controversial wording on Brexit, would be circulated.   1. Joseph Chamberlain left Gladstone’s government over the Irish Home Rule Bill in 1886, walking out of a cabinet meeting. Nominated by Allan Holloway, James Heale and Theo Barclay. 
JUN1	What doing journalism in a foreign language taught me about human nature	I have been in a committed relationship with the English language for almost 20 years. It all began in primary school, with clips of Muzzy (the animated character created by the BBC in 1986 to teach children English as a second language), the Winnie the Witch books, and group renditions of “Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes” (an international hit if there ever was one). Two decades later, English is the tool with which I earn my keep as a journalist. It’s the language I speak when I go home to my partner. It’s the pillar of so many aspects of my life, from the most fundamental to the most trivial. I read in English. I write in English. I argue in English. I dream in English. I discipline my dog in English. All this to say: the English language is the most useful gift I have ever been given, and I can barely believe there was a time when I didn’t speak a word of it. It has also taught me a valuable lesson about perfectionism.
JUN1	The Lib Dem surge is real enough, but Labour can claw it back – it’s the Tories who are in real trouble	The Brexit Party was bound to do well in the European elections last week, and it was always likely to overtake the Conservatives in opinion polls for a general election. The government’s failure to take us out of the EU guarantees a strong protest vote from Leavers for as long as Brexit is undelivered.  What was so unexpected about last night’s YouGov poll, however, was that the Liberal Democrats have overtaken not just Labour but everyone else. Lib Dems 24 per cent, Brexit Party 22 per cent, with Labour and Conservatives tied on 19 per cent is a poll finding that breaks all kinds of records. 
JUN1	America’s persecution of Julian Assange has everything to do with Yemen	I was in Kabul a decade ago when WikiLeaks released a massive tranche of US government documents about the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen. On the day of the release, I was arranging by phone to meet an American official for an unattributable briefing. I told him in the course of our conversation what I had just learned from the news wires. He was intensely interested and asked me what was known about the degree of classification of the files. When I told him, he said in a relieved tone: “No real secrets, then.”
JUN1	Donald Trump obviously believes in interfering in other countries’ politics – but Boris Johnson may not be grateful	Boris Johnson has just received two significant endorsements in his campaign to become prime minister. One is from Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who had leadership ambitions herself but who decided not to join the crowded field. She is the most senior minister so far to have come out for a candidate who is not him or herself. The other endorsement comes from the president of the United States. Some of us are old enough to remember three years ago, when Mr Johnson thought American presidents interfering in British politics was a bad idea, because Barack Obama said we would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if we voted to leave the EU. 
JUN1	Brexit Party MEPs must refuse to take up their seats in the EU parliament – like Sinn Fein in Westminster	Here’s a question: do the 29 newly elected Brexit MEPs believe that they will be attending the European parliament representing Britain as honest brokers? I think not. They should decline to take up their MEP seats in the same way that Sinn Fein does not take up its Westminster seats as a matter of protest. This dates from the time the first woman to be elected to Westminster in 1918, Irish citizen Constance Markievicz, did not take up her seat along with with other Sinn Fein members who had been elected. Instead, they formed the first Irish government, Dail Eireann.  Mr Farage and co would be sending a more honest and powerful message to Leave supporters by not taking up their seats in Brussels. The European parliament would be better off without their contributions and could focus on political discourse with the remaining 44 British MEPs who do want to be part of the EU political bloc. Sounds like a win-win to me.

JUN2	Sophie Turner’s ignorance of Northern Ireland’s abortion laws shows how flawed celebrity allyship can be	Press tours for feature films can be tiring at the best of times for all involved. Cramped in a small media room for hours on end, various journalists do their best to eke out quotes and heavily media-managed actors give little away in return. This week, however, it was striking that during a interview with Sky News, X-Men: Dark Phoenix actor Sophie Turner announced a strong political stance: that she would be supporting the film industry boycott of Georgia in light of the state’s new restrictive abortion laws. Mid-interview, Turner, the former Game of Thrones actor, laughs as she says she has yet to tell her agent, but that she would be joining her X-Men co-star Jessica Chastain in signing a statement boycotting any state where hard-won women’s rights are being rewritten.
JUN2	Gentleman Jack has achieved a rare feat: embracing a queer woman as the hero of her own story	Taking up space isn’t something women are conditioned to do. Almost 20 years into the 21st century and we still have to fight for every inch. Then an extraordinary woman strides onto our TV screens and shows us how to do it. You simply claim your place, she tells us. You do not wait for it to be offered and you definitely do not ask for it. That’s Anne Lister of Shibden Hall, Halifax, for you – landowner, industrialist, mountaineer, writer, lover of women – as portrayed in Gentleman Jack. She lived two and a half centuries ago. When it comes to TV drama, queer women are a cynical lot. It’s a cynicism born of being let down time and time again, in fact, you could call it an armour – a protective shell against seeing queer characters and relationships portrayed as dispensable, their storylines invariably about sacrifice and heroism, or catalysts for straight characters’ narratives. In fact, the “dead lesbian” trope is something that even Sally Wainwright, the producer of Gentleman Jack, has flirted with before.
JUN2	I don’t mind if brands profit from Pride – as long as the LGBT+ community does first	Whether it’s International Women’s Day, Mental Health Awareness Week or National Milkshake A Fascist Month, in 2019 big brands are falling over themselves to appear as woke as possible, and the global LGBT+ Pride movement provides ample opportunities for them to do so. June marks the unofficial beginning of Pride season, which means that it’s only a matter of time before it becomes physically impossible to walk down your local high street without being bombarded with rainbow flags, glitter and generic hashtag slogans in every shop window.
JUN2	I’m no pushover with pampered kids – but labelling struggling children ‘snowflakes’ needs to stop	I’ll surprise nobody by saying that the media is full of “snowflake” chatter of late. The Daily Star was called out by mental health campaigners for its recent headlines including “Snowflake kids get lessons in chilling” – a piece about how children are being taught mindfulness techniques in schools – and I’m sure I don’t need to mention which infamous breakfast presenter is a strong supporter of this type of labelling; often causing lots of emotional reactions from viewers who love to hate him.

Video games are, in terms of spending at least, now a mainstream activity.
JUN2	The shortage of nurses could have dire consequences – just ask those of us who see it every day	It’s worrying to hear that two-thirds of nurses feel that they are struggling to provide good care to patients who are dying as a result of staff shortages, as Marie Curie has warned today. Sadly, to those of us in the profession, this comes as no surprise. Too many nurses find themselves pushed from pillar to post, trying to make sure patients are comfortable but unable to go the extra mile due to increasingly heavy workloads. 
JUN2	Donald Trump wants the UK to be weaker – he’s the last person we should look to for advice on Brexit	The apparently nonsensical and undiplomatic utterings of Donald Trump should be listened to with great interest.    While the nationalists crow at the support for their isolationist chiefs, they do not realise that Trump is actively supporting the UK’s demise.
JUN2	Donald Trump is entitled to fair treatment during his UK visit – but protesters must still take a stand	A day after indicating that he thought Boris Johnson would make a very good prime minister, Donald Trump has once again given his two penn’orth by suggesting that Nigel Farage should be involved in renegotiating Brexit. Over the next three days, it is perfectly possible that the American president will have more to say about British politics. Indeed, it is almost inconceivable that he will be able to stop himself: he is, after all, not a man who adheres to diplomatic convention, for better or worse.
JUN2	No Labour grandee is above the rules of the party – Alastair Campbell had to go	Don’t be deceived: Alastair Campbell knew exactly what he was doing when he publicly declared his support for an opposition party, not least the party that propped up cruel Tory austerity and supported benefit cuts in exchange for a 5p plastic bag charge when in coalition.

JUN3	I've seen many US presidents meet UK prime ministers. This is what both sides will want from Trump's UK state visit	I have been present for many meetings between US presidents and UK prime ministers. They are never straightforward or predictable, and can be fiendishly stressful for those closely involved. The UK media look for any hint of presidential indifference — or, if that doesn’t stick, chumminess. Everything from the body language to the length of the press conference to the exchange of gifts is picked over for hidden meaning.  Visits succeed when both sides see a strong political incentive for them to do so: an upcoming election, ambitious shared foreign policy initiatives, or a common enemy. And where there is strong personal chemistry.
JUN3	'Debate me, AOC!' is becoming the catcall of the 2020 elections	If establishment Democrats need any more evidence New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is connecting with voters outside the Bronx, last week’s raucous California Democratic Party Convention provided an object lesson.  Fourteen Democratic presidential hopefuls descended on the Golden State to make their pitch for a share of its 495 primary delegates, yet no figure loomed larger than one who wasn’t even there: Ocasio-Cortez. It made little difference. 
JUN3	We wrote ‘Kill Tory Scum’ in protest at brutal austerity. Glastonbury was once a haven for political dissent – what happened?	Our electronic punk band Killdren has become the focus of a media storm over the past 24 hours, as Glastonbury decided to pull our set over our “violent” song “Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You)”. We were obviously disappointed to be axed from the line-up, but considering we were playing on a small stage at 4am, it’s likely we would have been ignored and no one ever would have heard of us, had the whole thing not been overblown by the press. The song has largely been misrepresented, completely failing to highlight the satirical nature of the piece and the underlying message. The “Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You)” music video and stage show are satirical works laced with some admittedly fairly grim black humour. The band does not condone the killing of Tories or children, or anyone for that matter – regardless of political beliefs. The pop song was created for the general election in 2017, to encourage people to vote out the Tories – anyone who has the musical stomach to watch the music video to the end will have discovered this. 
JUN3	30 years on from the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world is moving backwards	It is now three decades since “tank man” unwittingly created one of the great images of the late 20th century, one that might, for once, be fairly labelled iconic, by standing in protest in Tiananmen Square, carrier bags in hand, ready to die for liberty.  Unlike the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, and the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, both landmark events in the making of modern China, no one much in that country is commemorating what happened in that brief Beijing spring thirty years ago.
JUN3	This government is failing disabled children and their families	“Every day is a struggle of some kind or another, trying to juggle hospital appointments, meals for Jai, getting Jai ready for school and it all repeats itself the next day”. Pam Nagra cares for one of the 925,000 disabled children in the UK. She’s a single mum and the primary carer for her son Jai, a chatty 12-year-old, who adores football and wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He is also gradually losing his sight and hearing due to a rare genetic condition called Alstrom syndrome; and two years ago he was diagnosed with leukaemia.
JUN3	Europe’s merciless treatment of terror suspects won’t stem radicalisation – but it will fuel it	I don’t think there are many who have seen a horrific Isis video or read about their seemingly bottomless violence without having an angry flash of desire for revenge. The average citizen could be forgiven for the knee-jerk cry of “strip their citizenship, let them burn, they deserve it” since the group lost their physical caliphate and their members have been rounded up.
JUN3	Of course Trump is spending lots of time with the Queen — they have a lot to discuss about hereditary rule	He’s back: President Trump is in London for a state visit this week. Sadly, based on his comments thus far, Trump appears to be confused by British customs and traditions. Case in point: he’s already raised a few eyebrows by describing Meghan Markle as “nasty”. He’s also expressed frustration that he won’t get to ride to Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn carriage, as this marks the first time in his presidency that he’s not been able to successfully revert to 1950s norms. Rumor has it that he only calmed down when told that riding in his limo would emit more carbon. Despite a lack of carriage, Trump will nevertheless meet with the Queen. We can safely presume that he’s keen to learn how to perpetuate hereditary rule, get his image on currency and get his name into the national anthem (that could be the only way he learns the lyrics.)
JUN3	I’ll be spending Eid entirely on my own tomorrow – but here’s why I’m looking forward to it	When I was growing up, Eid in Karachi was a dramatic affair: heaps of food and the menu prepared days in advance; outfits altered and pressed, waiting on hangers; relatives spilling spontaneously through our doors. Somewhere along the way, things changed. My father’s mother passed into the light and our extended family splintered. I left Pakistan for many years and then unexpectedly returned, transformed in subtle but significant ways. Now, we celebrate differently. My parents go off on a trip, choosing to take a break from their commitments – which holidays more often than not bring more of – and focusing instead on themselves. I am left to my own devices with our German Shepherd to keep me company. Lit up but shut down, the city offers no distractions. I restrict myself to the house, listening to the echo of my own footsteps, the clanging of my single glass against my single plate.
JUN3	London welcomed Donald Trump today not with anger but total indifference (and a cock and balls)	Transatlantic flights into the capital tend to trace the path of the Thames then bank to their final destination just beyond Tower Bridge, so it could very well have been the sight of Sadiq Khan’s office out of the Air Force One window that prompted Donald Trump to reignite his Twitter spat with the mayor of London shortly before landing at Stansted. If it was thus, and alas we cannot know, it would barely have been a matter of seconds before London answered back, in the form of a 110ft cock and balls and the words “Oi Trump”, mowed into a suburban back garden by a student climate change activist along the flight path in Bishop’s Stortford.
JUN3	Trump is here to help carve up the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal – that’s the real story behind his visit	“The NHS is not for sale,” declared Matt Hancock, the health secretary, in response to US ambassador Woody Johnson saying it should be part of any future US-UK trade deal.  “Yes we’d love to make it cheaper to buy your life-saving pharmaceuticals - but the NHS will not be on the table in any future trade talks,” the Tory leadership contender continued. “My American friends know this.” 
JUN4	Will the West allow Sudan's generals to drag the country towards a catastrophic civil war?	If you want to understand what’s going on in Sudan today, it’s worth imagining the same events on home turf. So let’s pretend for a moment that London is Khartoum, Europe is the Middle East, and that extraordinary things are unfolding on your doorstep. A major protest is taking place in Westminster. People are asking for change. A change to social and political systems, and reform of the NHS. The British government, now run by army generals, agents from MI5 and MI6 and by police chiefs, is refusing to give in to the demands.
JUN4	American women should take a lesson from Poland if Roe v Wade is overturned	Draconian is probably too weak a word to describe the recent attacks on reproductive rights in the United States. In April, Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed into law the “Human Rights Protection Act,” banning all abortions after roughly six weeks gestation, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Less than a month later, Georgia’s newly elected governor, Brian Kemp, signed into law the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act,” which limits abortion to instances in which a woman is the victim of rape or incest, or, alternately, faces fatal medical complications.  Not to be outdone by her southern neighbor, Alabama governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill introduced by Decatur representative Terri Collins, a bill also known as the “Human Rights Protection Act.” Georgia’s bill criminalizes all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger, and subjects abortion providers to felony charges that could result in up to 99 years in prison. And right before the Memorial Day holiday, Missouri governor Mike Parson enacted House Bill 126, “Missouri States for the Unborn,” a ban of abortions after eight weeks’ gestation, with a criminal provision for providers violating the statute. 
JUN4	How the European elections did for the pro-Europe MPs of Change UK	For such a pro-European group, it was doubly ironic that what did for Change UK/The Independent Group – already small and now probably fatally split – was a set of elections for the European parliament. And by proportional representation, another idea Change UK vigorously supported. They were a disaster.  They failed to elect a single MEP. Their lead candidate in Scotland urged followers to vote Lib Dem. Their only solace was that the 3.4 per cent of the vote they garnered was slightly ahead of the rump Ukip’s 3.3 per cent. The Brexit Party, painfully, won 30.5 per cent. 
JUN4	30 years on from the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world is moving backwards	It is now three decades since “tank man” unwittingly created one of the great images of the late 20th century, one that might, for once, be fairly labelled iconic, by standing in protest in Tiananmen Square, carrier bags in hand, ready to die for liberty.  Unlike the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, and the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, both landmark events in the making of modern China, no one much in that country is commemorating what happened in that brief Beijing spring thirty years ago.

JUN4	I’m thrilled about Caster Semenya’s freedom to compete without meds – but toxic ideas about sex in sport are still rife	As of yesterday Caster Semenya is allowed to continue competing in athletics without being medicated. A Swiss court temporarily suspended the IAAF ruling which demanded Semenya take drugs in order to compete in events from 400m to the mile. I’m thrilled by this decision. A world where anyone is forced to take unnecessary medicine or lose their job is incredibly disturbing.
JUN4	Donald Trump and Theresa May’s joint news conference: what they said – and what they really meant	What she actually said: I am very pleased to welcome the president of the United States of America on this state visit to the United Kingdom.   What she really meant: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Barack Obama.
JUN4	No one does pomp and ceremony quite like the British, as a 16 foot robot Trump on a golden toilet will testify	Oh the pomp! The splendour! No one does it like the British, so the British so desperately love to say, and frankly who can doubt them? Where else in the world can a president of the United States wake to find that a 16-foot mechanised statue of himself with his trousers round his ankles has been installed in Trafalgar Square, sitting on a golden toilet, hammering away at his iPhone, barking out a range of offensive slogans at hundreds of decibels? Only in Britain, that’s where. These are trappings other nations simply do not offer. And, on Trump’s state visit day two, these were not the only trappings either. There were trappings everywhere. Down at the other end of Whitehall, half a mile from Robot Trump on Toilet, was Inflatable Baby Trump.
JUN4	Tory MPs may be enjoying the distraction of Trump’s visit – but he’s not pulling the strings, the 1922 Committee is	After the pomp of a royal banquet at Buckingham Palace on Monday, Donald Trump got down to the real meat of government business today, meeting a lame duck prime minister to discuss chlorinated chicken. The joint press conference that followed the leaders’ meeting held few surprises in the end.
JUN5	I was an evangelical pro-life hypocrite. Then I had three daughters	When Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana started passing anti-abortion legislation I remained silent.  
JUN5	Why we should (try to) take the Boston Straight Pride parade seriously	It’s LGBT Pride Month, but straight people aren’t going to let that stop them. Yesterday, news hit the wires that a group of men referring to themselves as Super Happy Fun America were planning a “straight pride parade” in Boston. The self-identified deputy leader of the group, Mark Sahady, claimed that they had worked out a parade route and applied to the city for a permit. They also wanted the same “accommodations” as the LGBT pride parade was being given. Reportedly, they wanted to upset the “identity politics” agenda. I was walking around an art installation full of color and vibrancy yesterday when I read the news. I felt an overwhelming sense of anger and sadness. It felt like a blatant mockery of everything I’d been through as a bisexual teen in a Midwest town, my sexuality denied and opposed by my conservative parents.
JUN5	30 years on from the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world is moving backwards	It is now three decades since “tank man” unwittingly created one of the great images of the late 20th century, one that might, for once, be fairly labelled iconic, by standing in protest in Tiananmen Square, carrier bags in hand, ready to die for liberty.  Unlike the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, and the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, both landmark events in the making of modern China, no one much in that country is commemorating what happened in that brief Beijing spring thirty years ago.

It made little difference. 
JUN5	Yes, we should be terrified of US healthcare firms – but wait till you see what’s happening to the NHS already	Privatising the NHS is wrong. It’s wrong because it wastes billions of pounds of taxpayers’ hard-earned money, it’s wrong because it has been proven to be less efficient, and it’s wrong because services inevitably suffers when costs are cut and profits come before patients. Privatisation has been on the increase since 2013 when the implementation of the Health and Social Care Act dramatically changed the rules. It became virtually compulsory to contract for clinical services through market tendering and NHS foundation trusts were encouraged to earn up to 49 per cent of income from private sources. A wasteful and costly system of commissioning has expanded NHS running costs by at least £4.5-10bn per year.
JUN5	The D-Day celebrations overlook one important thing – the killing of so many French civilians	The Glorious Dead will take pride of place in the thoughts of millions across the world on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. We remember those who stormed beaches, who knocked out anti-tank and artillery batteries. The invasion that started in Normandy on 6 June, 1944, was an immense achievement. Living or dead, those involved in the liberation of France will be referred to as “heroes”, as commemorations services and other events are held to mark their sacrifice.  What remains baffling, however, is the continued comparative lack of interest in the civilian victims of the Second World War – the deadliest mass conflict in human history, and one that still dominates the public imagination.
JUN5	D-Day veterans consistently refuse to be called heroes – why don’t we listen?	There are always soft strings on these occasions, soaring planes and stirring songs. There is always a politician with a studied look and a solemn word. But the old men never say much. Traditionally, a television camera bends to meet them in a wheelchair, and a news reporter stands by with a furry microphone and an anxious smile, hoping for a few short words that might be rendered intelligible in an editing suite. It’s not their fault they can’t get their words out, after all. They’re in their nineties, most of them. Except that, give them a chance, and it just might be they take a slightly different view on events than the occasion demands of them. 
JUN5	D-Day is well worth commemorating – but the leaders representing us today are a disgrace	I find it disgusting that a prime minister whose government relies so heavily on arms sales is attending the D-Day memorial today. Likewise, the warmongering Trump with his refusal to criticise people who wear swastikas. The same also goes for all the inept, incompetent Tory MPs who aren’t fit to lick the boots of the 90-plus-year-old people BBC Breakfast has been paying tribute to and interviewing.
JUN6	As a queer person living in New York, I cannot accept the NYPD's apology for Stonewall	Today, as New York Police Department Commissioner James O’Neill apologised for the actions of the NYPD during a 1969 Stonewall Inn police raid, I felt sick to my stomach.  Today I heard an apology 50 years too late, and it made me angry. As Commissioner O’Neill vowed that “this would never happen in 2019”, I could only laugh at that bold-faced lie. Because why would Mr O’Neill bother apologising when NYPD officers target LGBTQ people and people of color all the time? 
JUN6	The Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough has no policies – he can’t be allowed to get away with it	If the bookies are correct, and the Brexit Party is on course to win the Peterborough by-election, then we will see a seat that voted Leave in 2016 and Labour in 2017, elect a candidate whose one issue party pretend to be all things to all people. But they will be going to do a job where they will need to have a policy offer on more than just whether we leave the EU or not. To maintain this illusion they have deployed a tactic of refusing to issue a manifesto or even be drawn on any policies outside of Brexit. This may seem a moot point to some, but actually it is quite concerning. A manifesto is essentially a record by which voters can judge what issues parties prioritise, and what MPs stand for so that if they’re elected, voters can judge them on what they’ve achieved.
JUN6	Britain is speeding towards a social care disaster, and there is no plan to avoid it	How much longer will we have to wait for the long promised green paper on social care, let alone some sort of policy resolution?  We were told more than two years ago that it would be published by the end of 2017. Then it was supposed to be Summer 2018, then the Autumn. New health secretary Matt Hancock then promised it by April this year. It will now be published “at the earliest opportunity”.
JUN6	30 years on from the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world is moving backwards	It is now three decades since “tank man” unwittingly created one of the great images of the late 20th century, one that might, for once, be fairly labelled iconic, by standing in protest in Tiananmen Square, carrier bags in hand, ready to die for liberty.  Unlike the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, and the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, both landmark events in the making of modern China, no one much in that country is commemorating what happened in that brief Beijing spring thirty years ago.
JUN6	Sexual health clinics are on the austerity front line – and now STIs are surging	Just hours after the news broke that sexually transmitted infections have reached a 40-year high, another three clinics were shut down, this time in Scotland. By the time I’ve finished writing this, whispers of more shutdowns across the UK will no doubt make their way through communities they once served, with reasons ranging from staff shortages to funding issues.
JUN6	The Home Office’s lip service to Pride doesn’t change a thing – it’s still complicit in ruthlessly deporting LGBT+ migrants	As the clock strikes midnight on May 31, businesses across the world get a magical makeover. Shop fronts are adorned with rainbows, same-sex couples are all the rage and packagings and logos are covered by a multicoloured hue. At the best of times, this sudden and often short-lived support for LGBT+ people during Pride month can leave a bitter taste. But, yesterday when the Home Office followed suit, changing its Twitter profile picture to show the rainbow flag the injustice felt even more acute.
JUN6	Now that she’s going, it’s time to set the record straight on Theresa May’s ‘feminist’ legacy	Standing on the steps of Downing Street, Theresa May closed her resignation remarks by reflecting on her role as the UK’s “second female prime minister, but certainly not the last”. In stark contrast to her only female predecessor, Margaret Thatcher – who deemed just one woman in 11 years worthy of joining her in cabinet – it is telling that May chose to depart with a nod to her position as a consciously female leader. As the premiership of a woman once branded by the Daily Telegraph as “Britain’s most feminist prime minister ever” comes to an end, it is crucial to separate the rhetoric from the reality of May’s commitment to equality and women’s rights.
JUN6	Theresa May had her shortcomings – but Brexit will be just as big a burden for her successor	Chances are that future historians will be kinder to Theresa May than her contemporaries. They could hardly not be. Today there seems to be a very negative consensus about Ms May. In the pantheon of British premiers stretching back to the origins of the prime ministership with Robert Walpole in the 18th century, few have less to show for their time in office, displayed worse judgement and, most grievously of all in the present context of Brexit, were quite as blatant about placing party before country.
JUN6	We’ve bent over backwards to give Trump the royal treatment, so why not bung him the NHS as well?	That was a lost opportunity for our monarchy. The royal family would have become more popular than at any time since the defeat of the Spanish Armada – if only the Queen had covered Donald Trump in milkshake. At the very least, they could have insisted his car in the motorcade be driven by Prince Philip.
JUN6	Rolling the red carpet out for a bully like Trump is an insult to the honour of the D-Day veterans	Given the importance of the “khaki vote” in the Labour landslide of 1945, it seems reasonable to assume that most of the D-Day heroes would have been left-of-centre politically. How would they feel to see their sacrifice dishonoured by the red carpet being rolled out for a lying, cowardly fascist bully like Trump? Mike WrightNuneaton
JUN7	As an Iranian American journalist in exile, I'm used to online attacks. But I didn't expect the State Department to fund them	I recently found out that I am being smeared through an operation funded by the US Department of State. The “Iran Disinformation Project” launched in 2018 with American taxpayer money to expose and counter Iranian government propaganda. But as I broke the news last week, the project has also been smearing human rights activists, academics, and journalists, including myself, who criticize the Trump administration’s hardline policies on Iran.  As an Iranian-American journalist living and working in exile, I am used to all forms of online attacks by Iranian government-sponsored trolls. I just never expected to also be attacked by the US government.
JUN7	If you called out Donald Trump for dismissing democracy in 2016, you should call out Stacey Abrams and Mayor Pete today	It seems almost a lifetime ago, but in October 2016, the then-Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, tweeted, "Donald Trump refused to say that he'd respect the results of this election. That's a direct threat to our democracy." It was in response to Donald Trump claiming the election apparatus in the United States was "rigged" against him and refused to say whether or not he'd accept the results if he lost. 
JUN7	Love Island was once a useful glimpse at a world we hardly knew – now it just looks cruel	Reality shows are often dismissed as trash TV, and frequently that can be the case. But they also have their merits: journalists and viewers can use them to unearth more serious issues, from the way we talk about mental health to body image and behaviour in relationships.  There are series like Masterchef, Bake Off and The Voice that require skill or at least charisma, with the winners of those contests going onto achieve wider success in business or the arts.
JUN7	The casual, bloody violence inflicted on two lesbians on a London bus is just a glimpse of British homophobia	When the images of Melania Geymonat and her girlfriend Chris showed up on my Facebook feed yesterday, I was surprised to realise I felt nothing but numbness. I scanned their faces to see if they were friends of mine, or friends of friends; in London, you’re only ever a couple of mutuals away from each other. I didn’t recognise the couple, bloodied and traumatised after being gaybashed on a London bus, but I registered the dazed look of aftershock on Geymonat’s face, staring into the camera.
JUN7	30 years on from the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world is moving backwards	It is now three decades since “tank man” unwittingly created one of the great images of the late 20th century, one that might, for once, be fairly labelled iconic, by standing in protest in Tiananmen Square, carrier bags in hand, ready to die for liberty.  Unlike the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, and the centenary of the May Fourth Movement, both landmark events in the making of modern China, no one much in that country is commemorating what happened in that brief Beijing spring thirty years ago.

JUN7	Labour’s victory over the Brexit Party is a reminder of the enduring power of the political party machine	The result of the Peterborough by-election has come as a surprise to some, and a relief to others. The by-election was called after the local Peterborough residents utilised new rules to recall their sitting MP, Labour’s Fiona Onasanya, after her conviction for perverting the course of justice. For the newly formed Brexit Party, this was a golden opportunity to gain a seat within parliament, allowing them to claim they were a national party in the UK, not simply a protest vote in European elections. The Peterborough by-election offered them a perfect storm of circumstances to could propel their candidate, Mike Greene, into parliament. Peterborough was a Leave area and a constituency where the existing Labour party was stained by the actions of their previous MP.
JUN7	The Women's World Cup can be a huge moment for equality in football – but not without your support	I can’t remember when I started playing football – one of my first school reports notes that, by aged four, l already enjoyed kicking a ball around at break times. There were no girls’ teams in my local area, so I played in the boys’ squad at primary school until an all-female club was set up near me when I was about 11.  A few years later, I got scouted to play for the now-closed Cumbria Girls’ Centre of Excellence – it was surreal to compete against youth sides at Everton, Liverpool and Newcastle United. Still, the whole time, playing professionally never seemed possible to me. I wasn’t good enough; however, I also believed that I couldn’t make a living from it. 
JUN7	Labour scrapes to a by-election victory – and leaves the Brexit lessons for another day	The Labour Party should count itself very lucky that it managed to hang on to its Peterborough seat – just. The by-election was called, after all, after a recall petition prompted by the conviction of the previous Labour incumbent, Fiona Onasanya. Nigel Farage’s insurgent Brexit party fought a lively campaign but, being new, did not have the canvassing data that might have given it the same ability to get the vote out that Labour enjoyed.  Labour’s share of the vote collapsed by 17 percentage points, to 31 per cent, the worst winning share of the vote ever in a Westminster parliamentary by-election. With the Trump visit and the D-Day commemorations out of the way, Labour was able to make the most of the headlines about its defeat of the Farage mob, the “achievement” heightened by the widespread expectation that the Brexit Party would stroll to a landslide.
JUN7	Finland shows us what happens when a country embraces a proportional voting system	Finland’s pledge to make the country carbon neutral by 2035 is the most ambitious climate plan in the whole EU. This has happened because Greens are in government, winning 20 seats under a proportional electoral system and claiming three ministries: foreign, environment and international aid. Interestingly, Greens achieved this result with 11 per cent of the vote, which is the level of support for Greens in a UK general election indicated by some recent opinion polls. Yet in the UK the Green Party finds it impossible to be fairly represented at Westminster due to our archaic first-past-the-post system.
JUN8	Class A drugs, infighting and a dwindling membership – the Tory party is descending into madness, but they have even bigger problems	Has anyone seen the old Conservative and Unionist Party lately? You know the one. It had a diverse membership, a clear voter base, an ideological homeland to call its own. It was a coherent, disciplined, drug-free, election-winning machine. Today it is none of those things. To the casual observer it appears to have morphed into the Monster Raving Tory Party. Is this a temporary descent into madness or are we watching the beginning of the end for the party of the British establishment? There are two big reasons to think this is just a phase. For one, there is a leadership election taking place in troubled times. Candidates are keen to get those skeletons out of the closet before others do. A bit of class A for Gove and Stewart, class C for Raab and Hunt, and “I didn’t inhale” for Johnson. 
JUN8	Jeremy Corbyn is well on his way to winning the next election – here’s how	As long as we stay in the European Union, which I think we are likely to do for the foreseeable future, the Conservative Party is unlikely to win an election. In which case, Jeremy Corbyn is likely to be prime minister. I have rehearsed the reasons for the first two steps of this argument before, but the third needs to be tested. This week we had a live test, in the form of the Peterborough by-election.  The Conservative candidate did badly, losing more than half of the party’s share of the vote at the general election, when the seat was closely fought against Labour. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party did well, reflecting the failure of the government to take Britain out of the EU. And the Labour Party did badly, but not as badly as the Tories, and just enough to hold the seat. 
JUN8	The hypocrisy of the drug-taking Tory leadership candidates is appalling	I've never been tempted by anything druggier than a glass or three of Remy Martin myself, but frankly I couldn't give a damn what various candidates for PM smoked or sniffed in their youth.  I do care about the callousness they bring to their policies right now – and about the hypocrisy that allows them to turn a blind eye to class A drug-taking among themselves while cheerfully passing laws that strip the desperately needy of their benefits for several weeks, simply for having missed an appointment at the job centre.
JUN8	Michael Gove’s drug use should not disqualify him from becoming prime minister	Does Michael Gove’s past use of cocaine, a class A illegal drug, disqualify him as prime minister? We think not. Barack Obama admitted to using cocaine before he sought elected office. David Cameron never denied taking cocaine as a student, and Boris Johnson, who is Mr Gove’s main rival for the top job now, has admitted being given cocaine but says “I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose”.   In each case, their past drug use opens them up to the charge of hypocrisy, but has next to no bearing on their ability to fulfil the demands of high office. 
JUN8	The Top 10: Unused Band Names	This list started with the Deliverance Ministry, which really is a part of the Church of England that does exorcisms. I can’t guarantee that there aren’t bands with the following names, because there certainly ought to be.  1. Cato Street Conspiracy. Nominated by Rob Merrick, historian of attempts to murder prime ministers (that one, in 1820, aimed to kill Lord Liverpool and the entire cabinet). 
JUN8	Love Island was once a useful glimpse at a world we hardly knew – now it just looks cruel	Reality shows are often dismissed as trash TV, and frequently that can be the case. But they also have their merits: journalists and viewers can use them to unearth more serious issues, from the way we talk about mental health to body image and behaviour in relationships.  There are series like Masterchef, Bake Off and The Voice that require skill or at least charisma, with the winners of those contests going onto achieve wider success in business or the arts.
JUN8	Here are all the ways in which Philip Hammond was wrong about the cost of fighting climate change	Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has been making headlines this week with a leaked letter sent to Theresa May in which he laid out just how expensive making the UK net zero carbon by 2050 would be. The headline figure was an eye watering one trillion pounds. This came with the observation that it would translate into less money being available to be spend on things like hospitals or police. Number 10’s response to Hammond’s letter gives every indication that Theresa May was gearing up to prepare the government to make the necessary changes to put the UK on a course towards net zero by 2050. The argument is that this is what the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommend on the basis of their new comprehensive report. 
JUN8	Tfue and FaZe Clan’s epic legal showdown could have been avoided if e-sports players just unionised	The battle royale between Turner Tenney, aka Tfue, and entertainment company FaZe Clan definitively proves e-sports has the soap opera aspect of sporting competition as locked up as it does the other parts. Sooner or later it will be in the Olympics (it’s under consideration by the International Olympic Committee), and so it should be if the Games want to remain relevant to those under, what, 30?  For those responding with a “WTF?” at this point, Tenney is a pro Fortnite player, and an extremely good one. Think Roger Federer, Dustin Johnson, Chris Froome. FaZe has compared him to LeBron James and itself to the LA Lakers in a video it tweeted outlining its position in a legal dispute that could have far-reaching implications for an industry that rather resembles the Wild West in terms of the way it’s regulated.  
JUN8	Labour scrapes to a by-election victory – and leaves the Brexit lessons for another day	The Labour Party should count itself very lucky that it managed to hang on to its Peterborough seat – just.

JUN9	Don’t listen to Tory leader contenders – there will be no economy boost unless we accept the EU’s terms on Brexit	This has been the weekend where the Tory hopefuls have set out their stalls. Change the VAT system; don’t pay the EU its divorce settlement until there is a trade deal; cut the rate on student loans (that’s a sensible one); shut down parliament. To spoil the fun, let’s look at the practicalities – what the new prime minister will face after he or she is in place. Here are my top five negatives ones:
JUN9	‘Killing Eve’ isn’t guilty of queerbaiting – but it is keeping us on our toes	Anyone with a heart couldn’t fail to be moved by Villanelle’s agony at having to slide her feet into a pair of Crocs in the first episode of season two’s Killing Eve, which hit BBC One screens last night.   Murder, deceit, cruelty, a dagger to the gut – nothing comes close to the pain this fashionista with a firearm appeared to feel upon realising that her sartorial choices were to suffer if she wanted to survive. Such are the compromises this irrepressible assassin may have to learn to endure.
JUN9	The hypocrisy of the drug-taking Tory leadership candidates is appalling	I've never been tempted by anything druggier than a glass or three of Remy Martin myself, but frankly I couldn't give a damn what various candidates for PM smoked or sniffed in their youth.  I do care about the callousness they bring to their policies right now – and about the hypocrisy that allows them to turn a blind eye to class A drug-taking among themselves while cheerfully passing laws that strip the desperately needy of their benefits for several weeks, simply for having missed an appointment at the job centre.

JUN9	Unless dads take a proper paternity leave, we can't possibly know what full-time parenting really entails	According to a recent report about the introduction of paternity leave in Spain, dads were less keen to have more children after they finally realised how hard it is to raise them.  Say it with me: Men! Are! Trash! And now in Spanish! Just me? OK!
JUN9	The casual, bloody violence inflicted on two lesbians on a London bus is just a glimpse of British homophobia	When the images of Melania Geymonat and her girlfriend Chris showed up on my Facebook feed yesterday, I was surprised to realise I felt nothing but numbness. I scanned their faces to see if they were friends of mine, or friends of friends; in London, you’re only ever a couple of mutuals away from each other. I didn’t recognise the couple, bloodied and traumatised after being gaybashed on a London bus, but I registered the dazed look of aftershock on Geymonat’s face, staring into the camera.
JUN9	Primary school children are already accessing pornography – pretending it doesn’t exist won’t help them	I’m a sexual health education facilitator, which involves delivering sex ed classes in schools. Parents consistently tell me and my colleagues that their children are first exposed to online pornography at the age of around 11 – a fact that never fails to shock. Especially when you consider that plenty of mainstream pornography depicts situations that aren’t necessarily what happens in consensual and spontaneous pleasure-seeking sexual activities. According to a recent report by Internet Matters, a non-profit organisation working to keep children safe online, youngsters usually access pornography through friends, by seeing pop-up ads or the “get out of jail free” card – accidentally stumbling across it. Statistically, this means that there are many primary school children around the country accessing pornography.
JUN9	Jeremy Corbyn is well on his way to winning the next election – here’s how	As long as we stay in the European Union, which I think we are likely to do for the foreseeable future, the Conservative Party is unlikely to win an election. In which case, Jeremy Corbyn is likely to be prime minister. I have rehearsed the reasons for the first two steps of this argument before, but the third needs to be tested. This week we had a live test, in the form of the Peterborough by-election.  The Conservative candidate did badly, losing more than half of the party’s share of the vote at the general election, when the seat was closely fought against Labour. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party did well, reflecting the failure of the government to take Britain out of the EU. And the Labour Party did badly, but not as badly as the Tories, and just enough to hold the seat. 
JUN9	Boris’s latest Brexit wheeze is more self-serving nonsense	Boris Johnson’s plan to hold back the £39bn owed to the EU is pathetic coming from one of those most personally responsible for wasting nearly three times that amount on Brexit without a plan. Isn’t the whole point (if there is one) that a handful of self-serving individuals like Boris Johnson just don’t like being held to account by a greater authority than themselves?
JUN9	Boris Johnson’s Tory leadership pledges don’t stand up under scrutiny – MPs must hold him to account	Boris Johnson’s safety first campaign for the Conservative Party leadership might be out of character, but is undoubtedly working. The former foreign secretary, who failed to impress in that post, is the firm favourite in the race that begins officially on Monday to succeed Theresa May in the top job. His closest rivals unwittingly make Johnson more attractive in the eyes of Tory MPs. Dominic Raab’s Thatcherite approach to domestic policy and his implied threat to shut down parliament to allow a no-deal Brexit, rightly worry mainstream Tories. Michael Gove has been sidetracked, at least temporarily, by his admission that he took cocaine on several occasions 20 years ago. Jeremy Hunt may struggle to persuade the Tory members who have the final say to elect someone who backed Remain in 2016.
JUN10	The Tory leadership contest is absolutely out of its tiny little mind	I should state right now that I, like Michael Gove, deeply regret the decisions I took. I was a young journalist at the time. It was a mistake. I look back and think I wish I hadn’t done that. I speak, of course, of the profoundly dangerous, mind-altering decision I took to become a political sketch writer. Because I’ve just spent a full day with my nose pressed right into the glass of the Tory leadership contest, or TLC, as it’s known on the streets, and I’ll level with you: I’m absolutely off my tits.
JUN10	Boris Johnson thinks no deal will leave the country flush – the Brexiteers’ delusions know no bounds	The long cast list of Conservative leadership candidates seems completely stoned. Not on some exotic substance that has sparked the greatest outpouring of contrition since Henry II allowed himself to be whipped by monks, but on Brexit. It is an addiction, with each new mind-altering inhalation demanding a harder and harder hit. So a no-deal Brexit will be through parliament by October, says the Johnson Brexit pusher. “Paff! Is that the best you can do,” swaggers back Dominic Raab, who seems completely off his head by now. “I will prorogue parliament and force it through.” As hallucinogenic thinking goes it is up there with Keith Richards in the 1970s; the Stone later reflected that he could scarcely remember the decade.
JUN10	Nike’s plus-sized mannequins don’t ‘promote’ obesity – they reflect reality. Why on earth is that an issue?	It was around 9pm yesterday after I had just come back from a 5k jog around Greenwich Park when I was met with an abundance of notifications. I checked to see what the commotion was about and it turns out some inevitable but nonetheless not-so-great opinions came to surface about the plus-sized mannequin that launched in Nike Town London recently. According to journalist Tanya Gold, who wrote the following for The Telegraph on Sunday: “The new mannequin is obese, and she is not readying herself for a run in her shiny Nike gear. She cannot run. She is, more likely, pre-diabetic and on her way to a hip replacement. What terrible cynicism is this on the part of #Nike?”
JUN10	The CPS is failing victims by taking a ‘bookmaker’s approach’ to rape cases. That’s why we’re taking legal action	We are living in a time of enormous change in attitudes towards sexual violence. The #MeToo movement is emblematic of women rejecting the idea that we should keep quiet about rape and not name it when it has happened. Changing attitudes and reduced shame are driving a huge surge in reporting of rape to the police, and an even bigger increase in the numbers of women seeking counselling support. In a time like this it is perfectly reasonable to expect that our police, prosecution service and courts should simply keep up with the “demand” for justice after such a serious crime. Rape will never be an easy crime to prosecute, but the women, and men, who seek justice should have the best available “service” when they report it, including a fair decision about whether to proceed to court.
JUN10	Michael Gove’s drug use should not disqualify him from becoming prime minister	Does Michael Gove’s past use of cocaine, a class A illegal drug, disqualify him as prime minister? We think not. Barack Obama admitted to using cocaine before he sought elected office. David Cameron never denied taking cocaine as a student, and Boris Johnson, who is Mr Gove’s main rival for the top job now, has admitted being given cocaine but says “I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose”.   In each case, their past drug use opens them up to the charge of hypocrisy, but has next to no bearing on their ability to fulfil the demands of high office.

Say it with me: Men! Are! Trash! And now in Spanish! Just me? OK!
JUN10	China is trying to strengthen its grip on Hong Kong – but the people are fighting back	“I should have done more”, reflected Lord Chris Patten, the last governor of the last British colony, Hong Kong, on the 20th anniversary of the territory’s handover to China. In 1997, the country was left to the Chinese government with a form of rule of law guaranteed by an independent Court of Final Appeal, but no democracy. For the past 20 years, Hong Kong’s people have repeatedly fought for their rights. Yesterday again, one million Hong Kongese took to the streets to protest against a proposed new extradition law which could see suspected criminals sent to mainland China for trial. The possibility of facing the arbitrary criminal justice system of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the stuff of nightmares for many of Hong Kong’s citizens who hope to vigorously defend the freedom left to them by the Basic Law, the mini constitution negotiated by London and Beijing before the handover, and which was supposed to recognise Hong’s Kong’s differing capitalist nature and relative autonomy from Chinese society. 
JUN10	The new Tory leader must go back to the people – only a general election will give them a mandate to rule	As the candidates for leadership of the Conservative Party set out their stalls, it seems that their principal ambition is to roll back years of progress on women’s rights and civil liberties. First Jeremy Hunt proposes to continue his legacy of NHS cuts by slashing the time limit on abortion from 24 weeks to only 12, presumably in an effort to suck up the support of religious extremists and misogynists; then Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson – in an era of austerity, no less, when the only booming sectors left in our country are food banks and homelessness – proposes tax cuts for the most well-off, offset against an increase in national insurance that would hit everybody.
JUN10	Poems vs swastikas – there’s a cultural war being waged on the streets of Rome	Seventy-five years ago this month Rome was liberated by Anglo-American forces supported by Italian guerrilla fighters. Now, the organisation founded by those home-grown heroes is cheering on a 2019 street battle against the far right, and it is one that evokes the literary connections of that moment in the Second World War. Back in 1944, young German soldiers roamed the streets, disbanded. In the distance, some kept firing back at resistance fighters; others simply watched the allies’ convoy rattling through the city’s southern fringes.
JUN10	The question on everyone’s lips: which Tory leader hopeful is which US Democratic candidate?	America. Britain can’t seem to get enough. We’ve imported foreign policy, NFL games, Hamilton and fast-food induced obesity. And now we’re importing a bloated field of candidates seeking to lead the country. Fortunately, we’ve kept our British way of understating things: where America has 24 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president; Britain only has 13 MPs pursuing Tory party leadership and the office of prime minister. What’s less well known is that many Tory candidates have direct equivalents in the Democratic primary, which means they’re also getting nicknames from President Trump. Take a look:
JUN11	Andrea Leadsom wants to move on from the consequences of her own actions, and we will all just let her	Mark Harper has never taken any mind altering substances, but he does have a sign altering highlighter pen. This was what allowed the Tory leadership candidate you’ve never heard of to launch his Tory leadership campaign in front of a big sign that had been corrected for dramatic effect, from “Promising Brexit” to “Delivering Brexit”, the Promising lingering there, struck through in pink highlighter, and replaced with Delivering. So it was perhaps a surprise that Mark Harper, who’s not “Promising” Brexit, like some wuss, but actually “Delivering” it, wasted absolutely no time at all in telling his very small audience, “It is not going to be possible to leave the EU on 31 October.”
JUN11	Feminists, if you support the ‘Nordic’ approach to sex work, you’re co-signing the imprisonment of women	Over the last few days, the difference in feminist approaches to prostitution has been sharply crystallised. In Kildare, Ireland, on Friday, migrant women Adrina and Ana were sentenced to nine months jail for selling sex from an apartment that they shared. (Although their full names have been reported, I am not going to use them.) They are 20 and 25 years old. Adrina is pregnant. Working together is a safety measure that is used not only by sex workers, but also many other workers. The Royal College of Nursing, the British Association of Social Workers, and the trade union Unison all advise the workers that they represent to work in pairs or groups if possible, as it is so much safer. But for sex workers in the UK and in Ireland, working together for safety means we risk arrest – it is criminalised as “brothel-keeping”.
JUN11	Britain has 30 years to cut emissions – after Brexit we must lead the world on climate change	By 2050 the UK will have ended its contribution to climate change completely. Read that back. It’s an almost unbelievable sentence to write and encapsulates one of the most ambitious and significant climate targets set by any major economy in the world.  
JUN11	Save your outrage about over-75s paying the TV licence fee – there are always winners and losers in democracy	I found the level of indignation over the withdrawal of free TV licences for most people over 75 rather surprising. Andrea Leadsom pointed out the other day that it was made crystal clear before the referendum that there would be winners and losers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. I should add that this was not my understanding, but who am I to disbelieve our politicians?
JUN11	Michael Gove’s drug use should not disqualify him from becoming prime minister	Does Michael Gove’s past use of cocaine, a class A illegal drug, disqualify him as prime minister? We think not. Barack Obama admitted to using cocaine before he sought elected office. David Cameron never denied taking cocaine as a student, and Boris Johnson, who is Mr Gove’s main rival for the top job now, has admitted being given cocaine but says “I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose”.   In each case, their past drug use opens them up to the charge of hypocrisy, but has next to no bearing on their ability to fulfil the demands of high office. 
JUN11	Nike’s plus-sized mannequins don’t ‘promote’ obesity – they reflect reality. Why on earth is that an issue?	It was around 9pm yesterday after I had just come back from a 5k jog around Greenwich Park when I was met with an abundance of notifications. I checked to see what the commotion was about and it turns out some inevitable but nonetheless not-so-great opinions came to surface about the plus-sized mannequin that launched in Nike Town London recently. According to journalist Tanya Gold, who wrote the following for The Telegraph on Sunday: “The new mannequin is obese, and she is not readying herself for a run in her shiny Nike gear. She cannot run. She is, more likely, pre-diabetic and on her way to a hip replacement. What terrible cynicism is this on the part of #Nike?”
JUN11	By axing Munroe Bergdorf and listening to anti-trans trolls, the NSPCC has failed LGBT+ youth	None of us as LGBT+ people were naïve enough to believe that June, by virtue of it being Pride Month, would provide any temporary respite from Britain’s insidious brand of anti-LGBT+ hatred. But Pride Month has not only intensified the public’s critical gaze that looms over us, but has seemingly amplified transgressions against us, animating them and making them palpable – so that we can truly see, taste, feel, hear and smell how ugly our current social and political environment is. In this week’s episode of “How to Piss Off the Rainbow Community”, social activist and model Munroe Bergdorf sustained an attack by anti-trans lobbyists who flooded the mailing box of child protection charity, the NSPCC, with transphobic letters urging them to sever ties with her.
JUN11	The Charity Commission report into Oxfam is damning – the third sector is now fighting for its own survival	When it comes to a decreasing lack of public trust it’s politicians who first spring to mind. But today’s release of the Charity Commission’s report into Oxfam’s sex scandal in Haiti points to another group fast falling from grace: the third sector. Today’s report found that the charity had a “culture of tolerating poor behaviour” and had “repeatedly fallen below standards expected”. It highlights the failings of a sector still recovering from the Save the Children furore last year and hit again just last week with the allegations that the George Galloway-fronted Viva Palestina delivered no aid despite receiving £1m in donations.  
JUN11	Joe Biden is betting the house on somehow convincing us bipartisanship is alive and well in the age of Trump	This weekend the Democratic frontrunner beguiled the American people with a few sentences. On 10 June at a fundraiser, Sam Stein reported that Joe Biden said the following “With Trump gone you’re going to begin to see things change. Because these folks know better. They know this isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing."  It was one of those strange seminal moments were the American people had to asked themselves, “WHAT THE HELL IS JOE BIDEN TALKING ABOUT?”
JUN11	Rory Stewart can’t help but tell the truth – that’s why he has no chance in the Tory leadership race	From the big tent home of London’s most famous comedy festival, Rory Stewart launched the only Tory leadership campaign that wasn’t a complete joke. For the first time, toward the end of two long days of madness, he was the first of his kind to stand behind a lectern with his name on, and refuse either to gild the truth, or to flat out lie. And right at the end, it was the truth that finished him off, but we’ll get to that in due course.
JUN12	The Tory hopefuls have made a no-deal Brexit very real – a new Final Say march will remind them of their duty	In March I had the honour of addressing a million-strong march of people demanding a Final Say on Brexit. Since then the country has been granted an extension to solve the current crisis.  Rather than use that time wisely, as we were urged, we have witnessed weeks of no-deal threats from people who hope to take on the great office of prime minister and who should know better than to play fast and loose with the futures of young people, British businesses and the integrity of the UK itself.
JUN12	The fight to have the Final Say on Brexit isn’t over just because there’s a new prime minister on the way	Nobody should underestimate what is at stake right now. People talk often of Brexit as the biggest challenge since the Second World War. It is certainly proving to be a lot more difficult and complicated than was promised by those who won the referendum campaign in 2016. How strange it is, how alarming for our democracy, that those who made so many false promises are now making fresh ones in the hope of becoming prime minister.
JUN12	Leading conservationist appointed to Gabon’s government	Ask someone to think of an African elephant, and what most people visualise is actually a savannah elephant. Those giants of the open plain striding across landscapes like the Serengeti. But it is not the only elephant species in Africa. Smaller - and rarer than its better-known cousin - is the forest elephant, which has made its home weaving through the continent’s rainforests
JUN12	The NYT responded to outrage by ditching political cartoons – it is a sad day if you care about holding power to account	From next month the New York Times, seen by many as one of the best newspapers in the world, will stop running daily political cartoons in its international edition. 
JUN12	As we all head for old age, does Uber hold a solution for Britain's social care crisis?	There is a gathering sense of the huge importance of social care, and of how failures to tackle the problem affect us all. Take “bed blocking”, which is hampering effective health services in hospitals. The problem is a simple one. Patients (often older ones) get better but remain in hospital in the chair next to their beds. It’s not their fault, they are desperate to leave, but there is a lack of social care. They are not in bed but they block beds because they cannot be discharged safely.
JUN12	Michael Gove’s drug use should not disqualify him from becoming prime minister	Does Michael Gove’s past use of cocaine, a class A illegal drug, disqualify him as prime minister? We think not. Barack Obama admitted to using cocaine before he sought elected office. David Cameron never denied taking cocaine as a student, and Boris Johnson, who is Mr Gove’s main rival for the top job now, has admitted being given cocaine but says “I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose”.   In each case, their past drug use opens them up to the charge of hypocrisy, but has next to no bearing on their ability to fulfil the demands of high office. 
JUN12	Boris Johnson’s leadership launch: what he said – and what he really meant	What Boris Johnson said: It is a measure of the resilience of this country that since the vote to leave the EU and in defiance of all predictions the economy has grown. What he really meant: It is a measure of my resilience that, three years after wimping out of a bare-knuckle fight with Michael Gove, I stand before you, in a controlled environment, with strict instructions not to depart from my script. 
JUN12	Three years after the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, I still live in fear	I’ll never forget waking up three years ago. It was a Sunday morning and, in London anyway, it was sunny. Any hopes of a relaxing, lazy day were dashed, however, when I reached for my phone. A barrage of news notifications informed me that a gunman had opened fire at Pulse Nightclub in Florida, killing dozens of people. More details soon began to emerge: Pulse was an LGBT+ nightclub and the vast majority of victims were LGBT+ people of colour. I had only recently moved to London and, just a few hours previously, I had spent my Saturday night dancing at a gay club in Hackney. As the death toll quickly rose to 49,  the deadliest mass shooting in US history at the time, I clutched my boyfriend’s hand and texted my parents to say I loved them.
JUN12	Why we’re backing another march for a Brexit referendum and rallies across Britain	In March, 1 million people took to the streets with us for the Put It To The People march and rally to demand that voters should have the Final Say on Brexit. Today we announce that further protests will reverberate across the UK this summer in a series of regional rallies, culminating in another mass march in London on Saturday 12 October.  The date is significant: it will be 19 days before – in the worst-case scenario – the democratic outrage of the UK being dragged out of the European Union without a deal by a maverick prime minister chosen by 0.25 per cent of the electorate in the Tory leadership contest.
JUN12	Save free TV licences for over-75s by moving BBC operations to the midlands	We regularly see articles published which mock millennials for their allegedly entitled behaviour, often making such outlandish claims that more people under the age of 30 would be able to buy their own home if they stopped spending all their money on avocados and coffee. I have yet to see one article spouting similarly sneery stereotypes about the over-75s, maybe saying things like “they can pay for their TV licence if they cut down on their Werther’s Original consumption” or “give up your free bus pass and you can have a TV licence”.  In any case, if the BBC needs to save money I suggest it moves more of its operations out of London. The midlands already accounts for 25 per cent of the BBC’s licence-fee income but only 1.5 per cent of the BBC’s programming budget is spent there, while 19.7 per cent is spent in the north and 49.4 per cent in London. It has a sizeable base in Manchester and now that Channel 4 has taken 300 jobs up north to Leeds that leaves a large area in the middle of the country called the midlands without much media representation. Create a new Media City in Birmingham and that will save more than enough money to continue subsidising pensioners, as well as producing a far more representative BBC.
JUN13	Snowflake Farage has given in to foolish hypocrisy over Jo Brand's ‘battery acid’ joke	We should probably thank Nigel Farage, truth be told. His suggestion that a joke told by comedian Jo Brand on a BBC radio show amounted to incitement to violence, and should be investigated by the police, has proven something we have long suspected, but never quite been able to put our finger on.  When it comes to being a "snowflake", that most progressive of negative things, the political right are some of the biggest flakes in the blizzard.
JUN13	Listen up Democrats – the votes are in and the public is done with mass incarceration	On Tuesday, voters in Northern Virginia joined a growing chorus of American communities embracing substantive criminal justice reform. It’s a win for everyone. Democratic primaries in Arlington and Fairfax, Virginia, pitted career prosecutors against insurgent candidates running on unapologetic criminal justice reform platforms. By 9 pm, the results were clear: reform triumphed.
JUN13	An Isis killer and an unlikely hero have heaved open the cracks in Lebanese politics	Saber Mrad grinned up from his bed on the third floor of the Islamic Hospital with a hero’s smile.  “I’ve always been the kind of person to interfere if someone’s being hurt,” he said. “I’ve never been scared in my life.” Which is just as well. For the cheerful Lebanese with the Australian accent, his torso covered in bandages and far too many tattoos, had deliberately crashed his car into the motor-cycle-riding Isis killer who opened fire on crowds of civilians preparing for the Eid al-Fitr festival in the Northern Lebanese city of Tripoli.
JUN13	Leading conservationist appointed to Gabon’s government	Ask someone to think of an African elephant, and what most people visualise is actually a savannah elephant. Those giants of the open plain striding across landscapes like the Serengeti. But it is not the only elephant species in Africa.

It’s an almost unbelievable sentence to write and encapsulates one of the most ambitious and significant climate targets set by any major economy in the world.  
JUN13	The fashionable narrative claims moderates are dead – but voters say otherwise	Moderates. They’re toast. History. Britain’s done with them. It’s had enough of pragmatism. It wants what it’s got: a  choice between becoming an economically backward satellite of Trump’s America with long queues for limited supplies of fresh food at Tesco after a no-deal Brexit, or a foggy Venezuela, probably with much the same result.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is obviously a member of the out-of-touch north London liberal elite who’s spent too much time snorting recycled paper wraps of cocaine while drinking organic kumquat juice.
JUN13	Brexit has destroyed the Conservative art of statecraft – and it could take decades to rebuild	Some 10 Conservative leadership elections have taken place since that party’s MPs first directly elected the country’s leader. Edward Heath’s 1965 election, completed in days rather than weeks, ended the reign of what Tory rising star Iain MacLeod called the "magic circle" of Old Etonians. This undemocratic process had, McLeod complained, stitched up Alec Douglas-Home’s elevation as leader, and therefore prime minister, in 1963. The current contest, with many more candidates, party members potentially choosing the next prime minister and drug revelations is a world away from 1965's party in personnel and policy.  
JUN13	The Tories cannot face the truth of what they’ve done, so they’re sending for their biggest liar	You know it’s a big day in Westminster because the same old faces come shuffling up the same old corridor and into an oak-panelled room into which only they may go – to decide your future for you. The country is choosing a new prime minister. It will be the third of the last four that has been chosen without troubling the nation with the question of whether or not it would like to vote for them. When the current prime minister came shuffling down the corridor, she was asked by a journalist who she would be voting for to succeed her. “That’s none of your business,” she replied. She, who appointed all her potential successors to her cabinet, knows their strengths and weaknesses. But her opinion is something the public do not get to know. Not that they need to. They won’t be voting.
JUN13	Boris Johnson is heading for victory, but Rory Stewart emerges with credit from the first Tory leadership ballot	The main story of the first ballot of Conservative MPs is that the tropical storm known as Boris Johnson is closer to land than we thought. His will be one of the two names which go to the party members for the final decision – unless a large number of MPs switch away from him in Tuesday’s second ballot.  Johnson picked up 29 new votes, nearly half of the 72 MPs who hadn’t declared publicly who they are supporting. In the battle for the second slot, Jeremy Hunt picked up more votes than Michael Gove, but the big question is which of them will gain most votes from the three candidates who were eliminated today and anyone else who might drop out by Tuesday. 
JUN15	An inquiry into abuse at Brook House detention centre is welcome – but it’s the system itself that’s the problem	In 2017 brave undercover reporting by Callum Tulley and BBC’s Panorama exposed the appalling abuse of people taking place at Brook House Detention Centre. As a former senior manager at the centre I took part in the film and spoke about the mistreatment I saw. As the High Court has now reminded us all, these detention centres are places where the erosion of the rule of law is particularly likely, and particularly dangerous. The Panorama documentary showed staff assaulting and racially abusing those held in detention. Staff mocked people suffering with mental illnesses – and boasted about it to other staff. One member of staff is heard on camera saying, “If I killed a man, I wouldn’t be bothered.”
JUN15	Muslim men face pressure to ignore their mental health problems – it is time to stop the denial	It’s National Men’s Health Week and men’s health – physical and mental – is in a state of crisis in Britain. Male obesity levels are rising, prostate cancer incidences are rising and so are eating disorders like anorexia which, until recently, were very uncommon. With suicide being the leading cause of death of young men under 35, the mental health trends are perhaps the most alarming. Globally, depression has overtaken back pain as the number one cause of disability, as the illness has surged amongst men of all backgrounds. But my years on the frontline of the NHS during emergencies like Grenfell, as well as volunteering with refugees and internally displaced people in Calais, Lesvos and Iraq have opened my eyes as to how mental illness affects Muslim men, like myself, in slightly different ways.
JUN15	The criminal justice system is in tatters – and it will lead to the collapse of the rule of law unless something is done	The criminal justice system can touch any one of us, at any time. Suddenly – and quite unexpectedly – we could find ourselves as defendant, victim or witness in a criminal proceeding. You might be mugged. You might see your neighbour being assaulted by their partner. You might be the victim of mistaken identity in a scene of public disorder.
JUN15	In 2019, British people’s wealth and happiness is still a postcode lottery – and that’s not good enough	It is not right that in 2019 the lives of too many of our people are still subject to a postcode lottery. Whether it’s in health and education, or the quality of local infrastructure, there’s no doubt that a chasm exists between various parts of the UK. Members of the Treasury Select Committee represent 11 different constituencies. Since I became chair of that group of MPs almost two years ago, the economic differences that exist between the areas we represent have become abundantly clear. 
JUN15	Mea Culpa: ‘If you’re going to irritate readers, do it on purpose’	I am reading Dreyer’s English, the British edition of a book about style by the American Benjamin Dreyer, who is the chief copy editor of Random House. It is boisterously well written and I recommend it highly.  His advice is to try to go a week without using the words very, rather, really, quite or in fact. And the book includes several more lists, of “rules and non-rules”, “things to do (and not to do) with punctuation”, “easily misspelled words”, “the confusables” and “peeves and crotchets”. 
JUN15	The Top 10: Fictional prime ministers	This all started when Hugh Grant raged against Theresa May on Twitter and a fawning fan said he should be prime minister. Alan Robertson asked for better choices than Grant’s character, David, in Love Actually.  1. Baldrick. Leader of the Adder Party in Blackadder: Back & Forth. Nominated by Sam White.  
JUN15	Two years on from Grenfell, politicians care less about the welfare of British people than ever	Today marks two years since the Grenfell fire, a predictable (for it was predicted) and, as we now know, completely preventable tragedy. Yet still today thousands of residents of Britain’s tower blocks are sitting in unsafe accommodation.  Despite government promises to remove the dangerous external cladding that allowed fire to travel the full height of the building, consuming the lives of 72 people as it scorched the landmark housing block, there are still 221 similar towers clad in similar materials with work on its removal still yet to start.
JUN15	The Hong Kong protests could trigger unrest in mainland China	The Legislative Council of Hong Kong’s shelving of the China Extradition Bill reveals Beijing’s real Achilles heel, which is public unrest on a scale that poses an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party itself. Even as it tries gamely to apply the ridiculous and self-refuting “one country, two systems” principle, Beijing knows that Hong Kong has always been an ideological hand grenade with the pin removed. Events during the past week give President Xi Jinping and co a good sense of what mass protests and violence on the mainland might resemble should this ever spread beyond the electrified fences at Lo Wu. Despite its comparatively small population, Hong Kong has the least to fear in this scenario, because Beijing’s real horror is a contagion it could not possibly hope to stop.
JUN15	To remember Jo Cox, we must wrest control from Farage and Johnson – and embed compassion in our politics	Three years on from the terrible murder of Jo Cox and, though it pains me to say it, little about our political culture has changed. Memorials have been held and vigils observed, but the culture has, if anything, got worse.  Only two weeks ago Britain rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump: a racist, sexist misogynist whose values could not stand in greater contrast to the ones that Jo championed. In the first round of the Conservative leadership election, a man who referred to Muslim women wearing the veil as “letterboxes” and black people as “piccaninnies” secured more votes than the next three candidates combined. Nigel Farage’s stoking of xenophobia and division continues to gain traction. 
JUN15	Don’t ask why Chuka  Umunna joined the Lib Dems – ask how many will follow him	It was the attention to detail that did it. Most Photoshop efforts give themselves away pretty quickly. The lines are all jagged, the font’s not quite right, that sort of thing. But as Chuka Umunna stood there, behind that lectern that so clearly said the words “Liberal Democrats”, and in front of a large television that said the same, it really did look like the former Labour, former Independent Group, and now former Change UK MP for Streatham had joined the Liberal Democrats. One person who was definitely taken in by it was the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. So much so that he even came out himself and gave a little speech, introducing his newest Liberal Democrat MP, Chuka Umunna. And this was when it got really weird. So realistic was it that even Chuka Umunna himself believed it was real, because suddenly he opened his mouth, his lips moved, and he started saying that he’d joined the Liberal Democrats.
JUN16	To remember Jo Cox, we must wrest control from Farage and Johnson – and embed compassion in our politics	Three years on from the terrible murder of Jo Cox and, though it pains me to say it, little about our political culture has changed.

JUN16	Murder wasn’t the only atrocity inflicted on Sudanese protesters – they were raped too	“They kept yelling: ‘Today we f***.’ The girl screamed. Then everyone went silent.” The chilling testimony from Fateh, a Sudanese protester, is hard to listen to.
JUN16	Politicians can’t solve the Brexit crisis, so let’s get the royal family involved	A solution to parliament’s inability to solve the Brexit crisis would be to restore the monarchy.  The talents and experience of the royals are sufficient to create a cabinet of royals; several of them have far more experience than our government ministers. Prince Charles will be ideal as secretary for the environment, food and rural affairs. “Air Miles Andy”, with his overseas experience, will be foreign secretary and will look after International Trade. 
JUN16	The leaders debate proved one thing, there is nothing that isn't improved by the absence of Boris Johnson	People have criticised Boris Johnson for not turning up to Channel 4’s Tory leadership debate but, in fairness, it was Father’s Day. Johnson has more places to be than most. Quite how many, nobody knows. He’s also the only candidate not taking part in Monday’s leadership hustings for Westminster journalists either. Why isn’t he taking part in that one? His team say is too busy doing “debate prep”, for the one debate he is actually taking part in, on the BBC on Tuesday, compared to all the other candidate’s three.
JUN16	Rory Stewart puts the other TV debate Tory challengers in the bin	“You’ve got to believe in the bin.” Rory Stewart stole the show with a chaotic anecdote about his wife telling him he wouldn’t be able to fit three bags of rubbish in the dustbin. He compared his rivals’ solutions to Brexit to asserting that if he simply believed it was possible to get all the rubbish in the bin, it would be possible.  The accident of alphabetical order put Stewart next to Dominic Raab, the most forceful advocate of using the threat of walking away from negotiations to force the EU to offer a better Brexit deal. 
JUN16	Why we’re backing another march for a Brexit referendum and rallies across Britain	In March, 1 million people took to the streets with us for the Put It To The People march and rally to demand that voters should have the Final Say on Brexit.

JUN16	Will the real Ruth Davidson please stand up?	It appears that a third Ruth Davidson has appeared. A person called Ruth Davidson recently said that a referendum on Scottish independence should only happen if the SNP wins an “outright majority” at the next Holyrood elections. Prior to this another person called Ruth Davidson said that the next UK prime minister should continue to refuse a referendum on Scottish independence whatever the circumstances. In July 2016 another person, also called Ruth Davidson, commented it would “not be wise” for the next prime minister to block a request for a second independence referendum.
JUN17	Both Republicans and Democrats are scared by Elizabeth Warren. Let's talk about why	In early June, an unnamed adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used the anonymity afforded to him by a reporter to berate one of Sanders’ main competitors: Elizabeth Warren. Speaking with US News & World Report, the adviser, whose comments were described by many as “cutthroat” — though “cowardly” feels like a better fit to me — was dismissive of the possibility of a Warren presidency. 
JUN17	Rory Stewart’s idea for national service is a reactionary fantasy that will do nothing to heal society’s divisions	The bid for Conservative leadership was always going to be overshadowed by Brexit. But out of the fog, centrist sweetheart and Tory leader hopeful Rory Stewart has cut through with an idea for a domestic policy that he hopes will unify the nation: compulsory national service for 16 year olds. The Conservative Party has never been known as a mouthpiece for the young. Given that only 14 per cent of Conservative members are under the age of 34 perhaps that’s not surprising. Nonetheless, Stewart’s solution to national division reveals a blind ignorance about the state of British society and the role of young people within it.
JUN17	For women like me Kim Kardashian's new body make-up isn't problematic – it's a lifeline	Kim Kardashian-West has released a new range of body make-up. For many people this seems to be a step too far. Not only does society pressure women to wear face make-up on a daily basis but now we are expected to hide our imperfections on our bodies too? On the surface I understand why people are angry. Across social media there were many comments criticising this move.  One person suggested that: “The fact that Kardashian-West just came out with body make-up is fucking scary. Girls, just love yourselves and understand you do not need to cover your body’s ‘imperfections’ with make-up! Love your scars, your psoriasis, your eczema, and everything else! All bodies are beautiful.” 
JUN17	It's too late for Theresa May to solve the mental health crisis among young people – here's why	As she enters her final days in office, Theresa May has returned to the topic of mental health, one she highlighted in her first speech as prime minister. She wants to leave having made an impact on children’s mental wellbeing.  She’s not the only high profile figure to express concern about the issue. Princes William and Harry have also made pleas for it to be taken more seriously and for more resources to be diverted into prevention. It’s been suggested that every school should have a mental health first aider, trained to give basic support to people in mental distress. There has been talk of adding classes in mindfulness and resilience to the school curriculum. Now May has stated that she wants teachers to be trained in spotting the signs of mental illness among pupils.
JUN17	An inquiry into abuse at Brook House detention centre is welcome – but it’s the system itself that’s the problem	In 2017 brave undercover reporting by Callum Tulley and BBC’s Panorama exposed the appalling abuse of people taking place at Brook House Detention Centre. As a former senior manager at the centre I took part in the film and spoke about the mistreatment I saw. As the High Court has now reminded us all, these detention centres are places where the erosion of the rule of law is particularly likely, and particularly dangerous. The Panorama documentary showed staff assaulting and racially abusing those held in detention. Staff mocked people suffering with mental illnesses – and boasted about it to other staff. One member of staff is heard on camera saying, “If I killed a man, I wouldn’t be bothered.”
JUN17	Football, my father and me: how the pitch became the emotional middle ground we desperately needed	Before dementia began stealing my dad’s memories, he’d tell tall tales about me: swinging my left foot at a ball almost as soon as I could stand, or how toe-punts with him on the unkempt grass of our garden developed into kick-arounds in the park with friends. From there, I progressed to joining a team, utterly convinced by my own precocious talent; I was destined to be the next Kung-Fu-kicking King Cantona. My dad spent countless weekend mornings shuttling me across north London to my games, braving gale-force winds and sheets of the best British rain to patrol the touchline like a sentry. His robust mixture of criticism and praise rang out in my ears as I did my best for the team, but more importantly, my best to impress him by joining the swarm of other boys and flying around the pitch like an angry wasp.
JUN17	Rory Stewart puts the other TV debate Tory challengers in the bin	“You’ve got to believe in the bin.” Rory Stewart stole the show with a chaotic anecdote about his wife telling him he wouldn’t be able to fit three bags of rubbish in the dustbin. He compared his rivals’ solutions to Brexit to asserting that if he simply believed it was possible to get all the rubbish in the bin, it would be possible.  The accident of alphabetical order put Stewart next to Dominic Raab, the most forceful advocate of using the threat of walking away from negotiations to force the EU to offer a better Brexit deal. 
JUN17	Don’t believe the lie that centrism is dead – it’s growing stronger by the day thanks to the scourge of Brexit	As the disaster which is Brexit continues to unfold, it is clear something bigger is happening. The tectonic plates are shifting and the public is now more in favour of upending the two-party system than at any point in my lifetime. This provides a once in a generation opportunity to realign, change the system, fix our broken politics and resolve the problems which caused people to vote for Brexit in the first place.   Whilst on the one hand it is right to say the country faces a dangerous situation, particularly if a new prime minister seeks to crash us out of the European Union with no deal; on the other hand, there is cause to be hopeful and optimistic for the future of progressive, liberal, radical centre-ground politics in the UK.
JUN17	The Tory leadership debate showed the incompetence and narcissism of all our PM hopefuls	Have you ever seen such a bunch of useless, inept, insightless people as those five taking part in the Channel 4 “debate” last night? Leaving aside the pathological avoidance of Boris Johnson, the level of denial on display was staggering: promising to mend society with its child poverty, reliance on food banks, veteran homelessness, poor mental health access and so forth when their party’s actions have caused it all in the first place.  Do they have no sense of responsibility or remorse? Asked about their weaknesses we got “impatience” (Gove, an opportunity to grandstand followed), “being stubborn” (Javid, ditto) and “not knowing enough about the outside world” (Stewart, huh?). How about “I have no qualifications whatsoever to do this job”?
JUN17	Sherif's exit from Love Island suggests ITV only cares about the wellbeing of white contestants	After what many felt was a slow start, the fifth season of Love Island is finally heating up – with beautiful bombshells threatening the romantic security of existing couplings, and unforeseen plot twists ensuring that the love game’s dynamics remain fluid, unexpected, and gripping. But for many viewers, the uncomfortable racial themes which play out in the show undermine our ability to enjoy the series, forcing us to cringe and watch through our fingers as the villa’s desirability hierarchy consistently places the darkest skinned men and women at the bottom.
JUN18	Who won the Tory debate? Rory Stewart asked the right questions and Boris Johnson didn’t answer	“How are you going to deliver a no-deal Brexit against the will of parliament?” It is the only real question of the Conservative leadership election, and Rory Stewart asked it. Boris Johnson replied, although he turned to deliver his reply to Carmela, the questioner from Southampton, and said leaving the EU without a deal is “not what we want”.  In the chaos of a five-way slogan competition, in which various candidates tried to ask each other questions, all of them ignored the questions they were asked by each other, by the members of the public from around the country and especially by Emily Maitlis, the BBC presenter. 
JUN18	A Democrat contender thinks he can change America's gun laws in 2020. He's dreaming	When a presidential campaign is floundering, or in the case of Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif), it's never gotten traction to start, the candidate typically reaches for the stars with a bold idea.  Swalwell rolled out his gun control plan yesterday, and while it is sure to make The Brady Campaign and Moms Demand Action happy, the entire offering is a cornucopia of pie-in-the-sky ideas, many of which wouldn't withstand constitutional challenge. 
JUN18	Schools aren’t equipped to deal with the government’s mental health failings, stop passing the buck	Charlotte R Walker (It’s too late for Theresa May to solve the mental health crisis among young people – here’s why) is right to highlight the inadequacy of this government’s response to the tragic upsurge in the numbers of children needing treatment for mental health issues. Once again the government, which has cut school funding by 8 per cent per pupil, instructs teachers to solve another of society’s problems. It isn’t going to work. Twenty years ago, I was part of a senior management team that sought to introduce the position of school counsellor to a medium-sized secondary school because the NHS had very little to offer at that time.

JUN18	Murder wasn’t the only atrocity inflicted on Sudanese protesters – they were raped too	“They kept yelling: ‘Today we f***.’ The girl screamed. Then everyone went silent.” The chilling testimony from Fateh, a Sudanese protester, is hard to listen to.
JUN18	Football, my father and me: how the pitch became the emotional middle ground we desperately needed	Before dementia began stealing my dad’s memories, he’d tell tall tales about me: swinging my left foot at a ball almost as soon as I could stand, or how toe-punts with him on the unkempt grass of our garden developed into kick-arounds in the park with friends.

JUN18	I predicted Morsi’s death and no one listened – now Egypt must be investigated for torture	A former warden at the notorious “Scorpion” prison in Cairo, Egypt, said it had been designed “so that those who go in don’t come out again – unless dead”. This has proved the case with Dr Mohamed Morsi, who collapsed in a soundproof glass box on Monday attending the latest session in his protracted espionage trial. He became Egypt’s first democratically elected president when he came into power in 2012. Now he has died in the custody of the same state apparatus that forced him from office a year after that election.
JUN18	Taylor Swift's new LGBT-themed video is seriously damaging – here's why	Taylor Swift is no stranger to sharing the spotlight – while on her 1989 tour in 2015, she welcomed so many women onto the stage that it became a meme.  The video for her latest single “You Need To Calm Down” is cut from the same cloth. Released yesterday, it features cameos from a star-studded call sheet that includes an impressive list of gay, transgender, and queer celebrities including Laverne Cox, the “fab five” from Queer Eye, actor Billy Porter, Olympic medalist Adam Rippon, a handful of drag queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race as well as RuPaul himself.
JUN18	In the Tory leadership debate, the rare glimmers of truth were even more painful than the lies	Sandwiched in the middle of a row between Phil and Sharon Mitchell that’s been running since before the Maastricht Treaty, and a dystopian hell dream drama about the imminent collapse of human civilisation, it wasn’t quite clear where in the BBC schedules the Tory Leadership Debate either started or finished. But somewhere in there was a new and innovative form of national torture. A circle on the floor read Britain’s Next Prime Minister. What the nation saw was five middle-aged men, perched on bar stools, jabbing their fingers in each others faces like the climactic acrimonious scene in some fly-on-the-wall documentary about an unheard of Eighties boy band that’s gone back on the road to pay off its divorce bills and drug debts.
JUN18	Facebook's cryptocurrency could be groundbreaking – but winning people over might be another story	Facebook just announced its cryptocurrency project – titled Libra – backed by an impressive list of supporters. The vision is grand: to create a global reserve currency, built on a proprietary blockchain, and connect the 1.7 billion unbanked people with the rest of the world. If anyone has what it takes to create a global reserve currency and get it in the hands of millions of users overnight, it’s Facebook. With giant mobile payment applications already permeating societies (e.g. WeChat Pay in China), it’s not too far-fetched to see Facebook leveraging its 2 billion monthly active users (100 million on Messenger and 25 million on WhatsApp, both of which Facebook owns) and relationships with over 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses to create a digital economy powered by its own native currency. Payments are the big opportunity in Silicon Valley that social media platforms have yet to crack, and Libra may just be Facebook’s shot at winning.
JUN19	There are two people Americans will find tolerable in 2020: Donald Trump and Joe Biden	Kicking off his reelection campaign in Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday evening, Donald Trump was full of spirit and rage. We saw a president who believes he has been treated terribly unjustly by Democrats, the media, and everyone in between — and boy, does he want us to know it. "Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice and rage,” Trump said. “They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it. Not acceptable. It's not going to happen." Annihilation, then, is the stake in this fight. But while there was a sustaining theme of anger in Trump's speech, there was also one of resolve: the president and his supporters believe he is deserving of a second term. 
JUN19	Rory Stewart is out. The Tories have killed off the truth teller so that the lies might live	The next prime minister paused at the entrance to the corridor, shared a laugh with a pal and played a forward defensive cricket shot. A flat bat. Perhaps they were discussing the Cricket World Cup. Or maybe it was the fact that standing between him and the small room, in which he was about to vote for himself to be the next Tory leader for the third time, were around 50 journalists. These people would want to know answers to the questions he continues to avoid. Questions like, “Are you a racist?” The SNP leader Ian Blackford had just called him one in the House of Commons. Maybe something on the fact that his plan for Brexit, as shared with Tory activists at the weekend, is legally impossible, and totally unnegotiable with the European Union.
JUN19	I was the target of alt-right death threats across the internet – here's what happened next	When you hear about a cryptic death threat directed against you, the first thing that hits is a feeling of morbid curiosity. “Is it serious?” you ask. An existential dread sits in, you look over your shoulder but it never feels fully resolved. This happened to me and a number of other journalists after blogger Eoin Lenihan listed us in an article he published with the right-wing Australian commentary site Quillette. Lenihan claimed his article was a springboard to “further study”, but to us it looked like a clumsy attempt to discredit journalists by trying to link us to antifascist activists based on the accounts we follow on Twitter. 
JUN19	I was humiliated on the tube for being disabled. It’s time transport staff stopped treating us like we’re helpless	“There’ll be a slight delay at the next stop because we have an MIP on board who needs assistance getting off the train.” Kill me. Just kill me. Those were my initial thoughts as the MIP in question. For the record, it stands for Mobility Impaired Person and they spell it out rather than turning it into an acronym, which is perhaps just as well. Imagine being referred to as a "mip". 
JUN19	Both Republicans and Democrats are scared by Elizabeth Warren. Let's talk about why	In early June, an unnamed adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders used the anonymity afforded to him by a reporter to berate one of Sanders’ main competitors: Elizabeth Warren. Speaking with US News & World Report, the adviser, whose comments were described by many as “cutthroat” — though “cowardly” feels like a better fit to me — was dismissive of the possibility of a Warren presidency. 
JUN19	Politicians can’t solve the Brexit crisis, so let’s get the royal family involved	A solution to parliament’s inability to solve the Brexit crisis would be to restore the monarchy.  The talents and experience of the royals are sufficient to create a cabinet of royals; several of them have far more experience than our government ministers. Prince Charles will be ideal as secretary for the environment, food and rural affairs. “Air Miles Andy”, with his overseas experience, will be foreign secretary and will look after International Trade. 
JUN19	Trump has revealed his reelection campaign will be even uglier and more divisive than in 2016	Did anyone think a 73-year-old was going to change his orange spots? Who truly believed Donald Trump, aware his approval rating are at an all-time low and facing an impressive pool of Democratic challengers, might decide he needed to moderate his tone and extend his appeal?
JUN19	As a young Tory, even I can’t trust my party to pick the next prime minister – here’s what we should do instead	Members of the Tory party will soon elect their new leader, choosing our next prime minister in the process. In doing so, they are choosing which form of Brexit the party will force upon the country. The candidates are eyeing up no deal with varying amounts of enthusiasm. Stewart will avoid it at all costs, but most, such as Boris Johnson, are gearing up inflict it upon the country. It is right that members should elect their own leader, and even the next prime minister, in normal circumstances. But we are not in normal circumstances. We are in the midst of a national crisis. And the reality is that 0.25 per cent of the population are going to be deciding the outcome of that crisis. The mandate is tiny – and the consequences are enormous.
JUN19	Of course women outperformed men when a medical school stopped rigging exams – discrimination is designed to hold us back	When news broke last year that some medical schools in Japan had knowingly rigged exams in order to reduce the number of women working in medicine, I was shocked. Initially. For a moment, before I cast my mind back to my own experiences and tonnes of research proving the prevalence of systematic gender discrimination globally, it seemed almost far-fetched that an institution would not only deliberately take steps to hold women back, but go so far as defending that position. Almost.
JUN19	Don’t listen to Zac Goldsmith – Boris Johnson doesn’t care one bit about the environment	It is astonishing to see that some of Boris Johnson’s supporters are trumpeting his green credentials. Zac Goldsmith said yesterday on Twitter that Johnson would be “the greenest prime minister our country has ever had”. 
JUN20	Joe Biden taught us a lot about the myth of the 'good white man' this week	Since announcing that he would be running for President, the fond nostalgia associated with the man has quickly begun to wear off in favor of an acknowledgement of his controversy-laden background. Whether it’s his refusal to apologize to Anita Hill, his support for the 1994 Crime Bill, or his more recent discussions about working with segregationists, Biden continues to be a shining example of the “white moderate” Dr Martin Luther King warned us about so many years ago.  In his letter from the Birmingham jail, King wrote: “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice.”
JUN20	Alabama is what happens when Republicans run riot. And I'm not just talking about the abortion ban	Last month Alabama passed the most restrictive abortion law in recent memory, banning all abortions even in the case of rape or incest.  In fact, in Alabama you can now go to jail longer for performing an abortion than you would for committing a rape. Speaking of rape, Alabama is one of only two states where rapists can sue for parental rights.  But this is just one of the many Handmaid’s Tale-esque policies that Alabama has embraced. One has to wonder just why the sleepy state which ranks 50th out of 50 states in education is such a hotbed of regressive policies.  How did this Republican stronghold end up turning into Dr Frankenstein’s terrifying lab where an ultra-conservative fever dream is cooked up on the daily? Well, Alabama’s love of regressive laws started before abortion with one of the most restrictive immigration bills, a bill so restrictive it actually failed.  Which takes some doing.  And of course, the whole thing is somewhat ironic because Alabama is not a border state and its population grew by a meager quarter of a per cent last year. 
JUN20	Sexual harassment is rife in the NHS – I know because I was subject to it for years	When I read the news that nearly one in ten healthcare staff reported being sexually harassed in the past year I was surprised. I expected the number to be much higher. I worked in the NHS for nine years and the culture of lewd, disgraceful behaviour passed off as “banter” is one of the main reasons I left. I joined the NHS as an administrator because I wanted to work for an organisation that made a difference to people’s lives. I was enticed by talk of an inclusive, friendly environment with values of dignity, respect, care and compassion. I was sold a lie. Scratch the surface and you will find an insidious culture of sexual harassment passed off as jokes where complaints fall on deaf ears.
JUN20	Philip Hammond is usually sensible, but even he can't face the truth about Brexit's damaging economic impact	There are those who see Philip Hammond as the government’s Cassandra – the lonely voice of truth in an administration determined to slowly suffocate the country with a pillow of Brexit related lies. Except that he’s not. Not quite. He is a shade more honest than most of his colleagues, even though that feat is about as difficult to accomplish as cracking an egg in a glass bowl with a metal spoon. 
JUN20	I was the target of alt-right death threats across the internet – here's what happened next	When you hear about a cryptic death threat directed against you, the first thing that hits is a feeling of morbid curiosity. “Is it serious?” you ask. An existential dread sits in, you look over your shoulder but it never feels fully resolved.

JUN20	Thousands of university colleagues support LGBT+ rights – we won’t turn our backs now	As academics and other colleagues working in higher education, we are writing to register our support for policies and practices which are inclusive and supportive of our trans colleagues and students. Criticism and critique of policies and programmes that promote inclusiveness, such as Stonewall Diversity Champions, are not in and of themselves unwelcome. Such things are products of dialogue and discussion, and they evolve over the course of this dialogue. However, the primary concern must be with the wellbeing of the people subject to those policies.
JUN20	UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been found unlawful – this could end the war in Yemen	The Saudi-led incursion into Yemen is arguably the world’s greatest humanitarian catastrophe in recent years – leaving nearly 100,000 people dead, 2 million displaced and 22 million in need of humanitarian aid, not to mention creating the worst cholera outbreak in history – and Britain has abetted it. British weapons systems and personnel are sustaining the war in Yemen. Today the Court of Appeal ruled that the licence of billions of pounds worth of arms by Britain to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen has been unlawful. In its judgment, the court said the British government erred in failing to assess whether the Saudi-led coalition had violated international humanitarian law during the Yemen conflict.
JUN20	Boris Johnson should be worried about the nail-biting battle for second place – Michael Gove just might win	The fourth round of the game show known as the Tory leadership contest has set up a thrilling cliffhanger for the next episode this evening, with Michael Gove moving into a wafer-thin lead over Jeremy Hunt for second place.  Just as game show producers are often accused of manipulating reality TV and talent shows to produce an exciting finale, Boris Johnson’s campaign has been accused of skulduggery and manipulation to secure a contest between Johnson and the opponent he would rather face, namely Hunt.
JUN20	Boris Johnson shouldn’t get too excited – even with Hunt in second place, he could still slip up	The key thing to understand about the Conservative leadership contest is that the reset button has now been pressed. No matter that Boris Johnson only picked up a suspiciously modest three extra votes in the latest round. No matter that the whiff of skulduggery hangs all around the narrow defeat of Michael Gove for second place, and Jeremy Hunt’s unusually successful final push. (He added 18 votes to his tally – more than he’d added in all the previous rounds combined.) It looks as if Mr Johnson managed to nobble Dominic Raab in the second round, Rory Stewart in the third round, Sajid Javid in the fourth, and now Gove in this one. He won 51 per cent of the vote among MPs, but that might have been more had some of his backers not tactically voted for Hunt, as has been suggested.
JUN20	Boris Johnson will have no qualms about working with Farage once he’s PM. Remain MPs need to get their act together	I am writing In response to your report that Nigel Farage is willing to do a deal with Boris Johnson to only field single Brexit candidates in constituencies in the next general election. Before they go ahead with this, all Remain politicians must examine their consciences and ask themselves why they entered politics in the first place.
JUN21	President Trump, there's something American citizens need you to understand about Iran	Donald Trump: real estate mogul, reality television star, President of the United States of America and now, humanitarian. This morning the president announced that he called off an airstrike on Iran because he was told it would kill 150 people. This, after a US spy drone was shot down in Iranian waters, and after it was alleged that the Iranian government attacked two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. 
JUN21	The final Tory showdown is going to be nothing but impossible promises and wish fulfilment	None of the candidates had the answer to the question during the parliamentary stage of the leadership contest. Now, the shortlist of two will spend the next four weeks not answering the question in the Conservative Party members’ stage. Neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt have a response to the salient issue: how would you, as prime minister, get us out of the European Union?
JUN21	Two years on from the Windrush scandal, it's clear the Tories have learnt nothing	The Tories are doing nothing to prevent another Windrush Scandal This Saturday is the second official Windrush Day. Last year, shamed by the appalling Windrush Scandal, the government issued a series of apologies and established a day to celebrate the Windrush Generation and their descendants.
JUN21	Sexual harassment is rife in the NHS – I know because I was subject to it for years	When I read the news that nearly one in ten healthcare staff reported being sexually harassed in the past year I was surprised.

JUN21	The MPs tweeting in defence of Mark Field are making the world a terrifying place for women	Here’s a bit of free advice for all the male MPs out there: if one of your mates grabs a woman by the neck, shoves her against a pillar and then aggressively pushes her out of a room, maybe don’t jump on Twitter and tell people it’s no big deal. This is exactly what Johnny Mercer, Conservative MP for Plymouth, did this morning in response to the disturbing video of his fellow parliamentarian Mark Field assaulting a female protester. “Try being in our shoes… if you think this is ‘serious violence’, you may need to recalibrate your sensitivities,” he ordered, before telling people to “calm down and move on”.
JUN21	Five months on an NHS hospital ward could have left me malnourished	The news that health secretary Matt Hancock has ordered a “root and branch” review of hospital food obviously cannot come soon enough after the deaths of five people following a listeria outbreak. When I first heard that the deaths were being linked to listeria in pre-packaged sandwiches, my first thought was that I understood why the patients had opted for a sandwich. I spent five months in hospital last year, and sandwiches were often the only edible item on the menu.
JUN21	Boris Johnson may have been London’s cheerleader in 2012 but he did not ‘deliver the Olympics’. Far from it	“Boris Johnson delivered the Olympics.” It is a line that is not so much creeping as shoehorning its way into the public debate over Britain’s next prime minister. It is one of Team Boris’s approved lines, when it sends ambitious Tory MPs into the TV and radio studios because Johnson is too conniving to appear himself. On Thursday night, Kwasi Kwarteng was the latest to come out with it, this time on BBC’s Question Time. Anyone who knows anything about the delivery of the Olympics, and there are hundreds such people around, if not thousands, has the same reaction to this apparent truth. It is to laugh. Boris Johnson himself is among those people. I would be incredibly surprised if his own private reaction to the idea he “delivered the Olympics” would be to anything but chuckle to himself.
JUN21	Boris Johnson is the wrong man at the wrong time for the country I love	I share Tom Peck’s anguish about the inevitable march to victory of a man who even long-time conservative commentators regard as an idle, incompetent, lying charlatan. Boris Johnson will be chosen by a small group of overwhelmingly middle-aged white men to be prime minister of a country of 66 million people, who are bitterly divided and suffering intractable social and economic problems.
JUN22	The 'row' in Carrie Symonds' flat is not just a 'lovers' tiff' we should turn a blind eye to	At this point none of us know exactly what happened on Thursday night between our potential future prime minister and his partner, and we may never know. All I want to say on the specifics of that incident is that I hope Carrie Symonds is okay; I hope she wasn’t hurt, and I hope she didn’t feel threatened. In these circumstances, she deserves absolute respect and privacy. The resulting speculation and commentary around the incident however, are telling of just how far we haven’t come since feminist campaigners began the tireless work to get domestic abuse recognised as a matter of public and criminal concern – a matter that we should never turn a blind eye to.
JUN22	On National Windrush Day, this is the history of British immigration policy and how we can change it	“Good race relations require tough immigration policies” is a crude but apt summary of the post-war political consensus on race and immigration in Britain.   Theresa May’s time in office, first as home secretary and then prime minister, has seen this consensus tested to its very limits. For almost a decade, her often-repeated commitment to address the “burning injustice” of racial discrimination has sat awkwardly alongside her unfiltered hostility towards migrants and their families.  
JUN22	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper. Substantial areas of the population now have no form of local paper at all.  The industry is suffering inexorable decline. London, the capital city, hub of the nation’s economy, and political and cultural life, is not immune. The Evening Standard was on the cusp of closure under its former owners, and rescued by Evgeny Lebedev. Then, when sales continued to be eroded by the internet, London’s only evening newspaper abandoned its traditional paid-for model and went free. Life for the paper, though, remained a struggle. 
JUN22	How Zimbabwe is rewriting its tourism future	Zimbabwe knows it has challenges ahead. The creation of a new government by President Emmerson D. Mnangagwa in 2017 signalled a new direction for the country, but changing the global perception of a nation takes time - and huge effort. Yet Zimbabwe’s Minister for Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Priscah Mupfumira is on a mission to do exactly that. Since 2017 the Ministry under Ms Mupfumira’s leadership has worked doggedly to boost tourism by telling the world that Zimbabwe is now open for business. Zimbabwe has participated in many recent international tourism events, including Meetings Africa and the International Tourism Bourse, to widen understanding about the wealth of riches the country has to offer. It is this awareness of Zimbabwe's natural abundance - and a deep pride in her homeland - that drives Minister Mupfumira's dedication to her work.
JUN22	Joe Biden taught us a lot about the myth of the 'good white man' this week	Since announcing that he would be running for President, the fond nostalgia associated with the man has quickly begun to wear off in favor of an acknowledgement of his controversy-laden background. Whether it’s his refusal to apologize to Anita Hill, his support for the 1994 Crime Bill, or his more recent discussions about working with segregationists, Biden continues to be a shining example of the “white moderate” Dr Martin Luther King warned us about so many years ago.  In his letter from the Birmingham jail, King wrote: “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice.”
JUN22	Thousands of university colleagues support LGBT+ rights – we won’t turn our backs now	As academics and other colleagues working in higher education, we are writing to register our support for policies and practices which are inclusive and supportive of our trans colleagues and students. Criticism and critique of policies and programmes that promote inclusiveness, such as Stonewall Diversity Champions, are not in and of themselves unwelcome. Such things are products of dialogue and discussion, and they evolve over the course of this dialogue. However, the primary concern must be with the wellbeing of the people subject to those policies.
JUN22	Whatever happened in Carrie Symonds’ flat, Boris Johnson is still set to become prime minister	Boris Johnson’s campaign to become prime minister has suffered a setback, but he will probably plough on to a slightly less overwhelming victory than he otherwise would have won.  Conservative Party members are likely to take a liberal view of his row with his girlfriend, who was a key member of his campaign team. They may not all be as hyper-partisan as some of Johnson’s supporters, who blamed the neighbours for calling the police, but their party loyalties make it likely that they will filter what they want to hear from the shouting. 
JUN22	I used to be a Leave-voting Tory – this leadership race is yet more proof we need a Final Say	The last time I wrote about my political views was in 2017 after the General Election, whilst I was still a Tory who believed in leaving the EU. Oh, how times have changed! And times really have changed, not just for me, but for Brexit itself. The promises that were made in 2016 have turned out to be guff. Now, instead of getting an easy deal as was promised, we’re hurtling towards leaving the EU without a deal at all. In other words, driving the car straight into the wall just for the sake of it.
JUN22	The Tory membership’s obsession with a no-deal Brexit is forcing our voters to flee to other parties	The word “democracy” is always seen positively. When I heard the term “party democracy” with regard to my own party, the Conservatives, it sounded like something to be welcomed. Instead, just as for Labour and US Republicans, it has been a disaster, leaving us in thrall to a group of self-selected activists whose views no longer represent those of our voters or our longstanding philosophy. The idea that party members should have a say in selecting the leader sounds plausible enough. After all, they help to fund and run the national network on which each party depends.
JUN22	Tory leadership hustings: Boris Johnson was as lukewarm as a Rotary Club after-dinner speaker	So a couple of TV firsts there then. The controversial drama critic Kenneth Tynan may have been the first person to utter the F-word on British television back in 1965, but it was left to a Conservative Party activist from the West Midlands to drop an F-bomb on a Saturday afternoon on rolling news, as an official Tory party event was streamed live to the Great British public. The guy with the bleep machine must have been off duty, understandably. BBC news presenter Lukwesa Burak apologised for the use of the “direct quotation”. The foul word was originally used, of course, about business interests by Boris Johnson who dismissed it as a “stray remark to the Belgian ambassador”. So that’s all right then.
JUN23	A Final Say referendum is the only thing standing between Corbyn and victory at the next general election	The last few weeks have radically changed the face of British politics. The Liberal Democrats, having languished in single figures for the best part of a decade, now vie on equal terms with the other parties in what appears to be a new kind of four-party politics. Chuka Umunna’s decision to join the Lib Dems last week raises the prospect of others following. The two traditionally major parties are cracking and melting like the Arctic ice sheet.   While the media inevitably focus on the uncertainty around who will lead the Conservative Party, there are three potentially more important imponderables of a structural rather than personal nature.
JUN23	Why we, as academics, created a letter in support of LGBT+ rights	On 16 June, a letter from 34 academics to The Sunday Times argued that university policies to include trans and gender diverse people, in particular the Stonewall Diversity Champions programme, were in tension with “academic freedom of thought”. For us – as ordinary academics working in higher education – this felt like just the latest in a slew of media coverage on trans people which has ranged from the critical to the sensationalist. Setting out to write a response, we found that what we really wanted to do was something much greater: a manifesto, an affirmation of our LGBTQIA+ colleagues at all levels of higher education. At the time of writing, our manifesto – our contribution to the debate – has attracted the signatures of more than 6,000 university staff from across the world. We have also received a vast number of personal responses expressing relief and gratitude that someone has taken a vocal stand in support of trans, gender-diverse and other queer students and colleagues, representing the views of what feels like the silent majority against the few critical voices in the media.
JUN23	Toolkit guides African governments to multiply earnings from national parks	National parks and other state-owned conservation areas could significantly multiply the revenue they pump into African economies, a new report has found.  Bringing new private-sector investment to underfunded protected areas would help fund conservation without draining state finances. It would also increase jobs and drive sustainable local and national development. 
JUN23	Toxic male behaviour is rife in society – if the Labour Party really wants to set an example, now is the time	How many women have you met that don’t have a grim story in which a man made them feel intimated and/or acted violently against them? I pose this question without needing the answer, statistics prove that the majority will. When I began to plan this piece, I started by unravelling my experience as a woman in a male world. My journey with toxic male behaviour is not out of the ordinary; I experienced some casual sexism in school, a sexual assault when I was 13, adolescence; and, eventually, I entered the scary world of dating. Reflecting on my experience thus far, can be at times harrowing, but what’s worse is it is totally unremarkable.
JUN23	Mea Culpa: Staying put in politics, whatever the time may be	In what we call a front-page puff, a short headline above the masthead on the front page of the Daily Edition, we said: “Farage isn’t going away any time soon.” This was a waste of space, because “any time soon” means the same as “soon”. We used “any time soon” five times this week, which is five times too many.  Mind you, it was better than one of the headlines on the same article that we used on the website: “Farage isn’t going anywhere – and Peterborough proves it.” Many politicians have fallen into the trap of declaring that they are “not going anywhere” – overlooking the ambiguity of a phrase that can mean either that they refuse to be pushed out or that they are making no progress.  
JUN23	How Zimbabwe is rewriting its tourism future	Zimbabwe knows it has challenges ahead. The creation of a new government by President Emmerson D. Mnangagwa in 2017 signalled a new direction for the country, but changing the global perception of a nation takes time - and huge effort. Yet Zimbabwe’s Minister for Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Priscah Mupfumira is on a mission to do exactly that. Since 2017 the Ministry under Ms Mupfumira’s leadership has worked doggedly to boost tourism by telling the world that Zimbabwe is now open for business. Zimbabwe has participated in many recent international tourism events, including Meetings Africa and the International Tourism Bourse, to widen understanding about the wealth of riches the country has to offer. It is this awareness of Zimbabwe's natural abundance - and a deep pride in her homeland - that drives Minister Mupfumira's dedication to her work.
JUN23	On National Windrush Day, this is the history of British immigration policy and how we can change it	“Good race relations require tough immigration policies” is a crude but apt summary of the post-war political consensus on race and immigration in Britain.   Theresa May’s time in office, first as home secretary and then prime minister, has seen this consensus tested to its very limits. For almost a decade, her often-repeated commitment to address the “burning injustice” of racial discrimination has sat awkwardly alongside her unfiltered hostility towards migrants and their families.  
JUN23	The Tory membership’s obsession with a no-deal Brexit is forcing our voters to flee to other parties	The word “democracy” is always seen positively. When I heard the term “party democracy” with regard to my own party, the Conservatives, it sounded like something to be welcomed.

JUN23	Boris Johnson, take a leaf from Trump’s book and be bold – Jeremy Hunt’s true views on Brexit must be challenged	I urge Boris Johnson to hole our phony Brexiteer Jeremy Hunt’s ship beneath the waterline, by asking him how a man who only a few months ago stated that the EU resembled the Soviet Union (in that it was a giant prison camp), could have voted Remain in 2016. By definition, Hunt was back then giving a thumbs up to his fellow Brits being imprisoned for generations to come.
JUN23	Tory leadership hustings: Boris Johnson was as lukewarm as a Rotary Club after-dinner speaker	So a couple of TV firsts there then. The controversial drama critic Kenneth Tynan may have been the first person to utter the F-word on British television back in 1965, but it was left to a Conservative Party activist from the West Midlands to drop an F-bomb on a Saturday afternoon on rolling news, as an official Tory party event was streamed live to the Great British public.

JUN24	We thought Pete Buttigieg was qualified to be president. Then a shooting showed how mistaken we were	Before the unofficial kickoff to the 2020 Democratic primary season, most politically engaged people outside of the state of Indiana had never heard of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  This past January, Buttigieg created an exploratory committee, and that's when "Mayor Pete" started attracting the attention of the media. In many cases, he was fawned over by news anchors and praised disproportionately in print. His credentials remained, for the most part, unexamined.
JUN24	Unpick all the lies Trump has told about Iran and you get to the narcissistic truth	President Trump made the right decision in not launching a military strike against Iran that could have quickly led to war, but he arrived at this decision showing all of the egotism, ignorance and disorganization that has characterized the last two and a half years. Now the stakes are higher and there is nothing about his made-for-television moment recalling bombers in the air that should provide any comfort for the future. Because Trump lies all the time and says only what he thinks will help him in the moment, it is hard to know what actually happened. It is agreed that an unmanned drone was shot down by Iran. A companion aircraft with military personnel aboard was also nearby but was not shot down. 
JUN24	Zimbabwean President says sale of ivory stocks could fund conservation for 'next 20 years'	Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has called for multilateral treaties such as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to promote a balance between conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, saying he was “gravely concerned” that the banning of trade of wildlife products was creeping into CITES decision-making processes.  President Mnangagwa, who made the announcement at the inaugural African Wildlife Economy summit 23-25 June in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, said that his country was sitting on $600 million worth of ivory and rhino horn. According to the President, the revenue that could be generated from the stocks - obtained at the natural death of animals- if trade of the products was legalised, would fund the operational budget of Zimbabwe’s national parks for the next 20 years.
JUN24	We need to do a better job of including black women in conversations about HIV and PrEP	In an era of rising sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates, it is important to consider the preventative tools that can and should be used to reduce STIs and HIV acquisition. There are four tools that we can all use to stop the transmission of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus); consistent condom use, regular STI testing, HIV treatment and PrEP, also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis.
JUN24	Ivor Cummings was the ‘gay father of the Windrush generation’ – so why haven’t we heard of him?	The first National Windrush Day has come and gone. It was an observance torn between celebration of the postwar arrival of Britons from the Caribbean, and protestation of the unacceptable treatment being meted out to members of that group and some of their descendants. All in all, it was a moment for critical reflection. However, an important name in this community’s history continues to go unspoken. The question is: why? Meet Ivor Gustavus Cummings, OBE (1913-1992), the father of the Windrush generation. He was a “coloured queer”. That is the description used in his day for people like him, people of African descent who sought romantic and sexual partners from among their own gender. Cummings never hid who he was. He was open about being a black gay man, the modern terminology by which he would likely describe himself were he still alive today. He accepted the name “queer” long before the movement from the LGBT+ community to reclaim it emerged in the 1990s.
JUN24	Mea Culpa: Staying put in politics, whatever the time may be	In what we call a front-page puff, a short headline above the masthead on the front page of the Daily Edition, we said: “Farage isn’t going away any time soon.” This was a waste of space, because “any time soon” means the same as “soon”.

JUN24	He says he wants no deal, but he’ll just give us May’s deal repackaged instead. Welcome to Boris’s ‘vassal state’	Wouldn’t it be funny if, after months of trauma, Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt just ended up resuscitating Theresa May’s Brexit deal? I mean, yes, it’s a national tragedy, but it has a certain irony attached to it. As all agree, the one thing that might – might – conceivably secure Britain a new, better deal would be a credible threat of no deal. Boris Johnson and, more equivocally, Jeremy Hunt want it put it back on the table. Can they?
JUN24	The tide has turned on BP sponsorship – now cultural institutions like the Royal Shakespeare Company must act	To BP, or not to BP? That is the question that leading artists and musicians have been putting to BP-sponsored cultural institutions in the last fortnight. And on Friday, Oscar-winning actor Sir Mark Rylance added to the mounting pressure by announcing his resignation from the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) over its ties to BP, saying: “I do not wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer, a tobacco salesman or anyone who willfully destroys the lives of others alive or unborn.” The ethical case against oil sponsorship is clear cut. In the midst of a climate emergency, BP is continuing to lobby against climate legislation, while planning to spend £41bn on exploring for new oil over the coming decade. But despite this, those at the top of the RSC and other BP-sponsored institutions are still standing by their sponsor, continuing to give legitimacy to a company whose business plans makes a mockery of the Paris climate goals. Directors and Boards of Trustees have a duty to protect the reputation of their institutions and make sure sponsors share their values. BP now poses a serious reputational risk.
JUN24	The many parallels between an ailing Tory government and Top Gear	Parallels can be drawn between the Top Gear of old and the Tory party: both have a May and a Hammond, and the third member of the presentation team is a politically incorrect schoolboy who everyone says is “intelligent” despite outward appearances. I wonder if the Tory party will end up like Top Gear – a shadow of its former self, never to recover its “glory days” after its overindulged presenter acted true to form, went too far and caused the instant demise of a bastion of British life? Jane HolbrookCromer
JUN24	Imamoglu’s victory has changed Turkish politics for good. But does this mean the end of Erdogan?	It’s been 25 years since Recep Tayyip Erdogan won the Istanbul mayoral election. “Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey,” is a phrase he coined in the meantime – and consequently proved to be true as shown from his own ascent to the presidency. So there was a considerable amount at stake for the whole of Turkey during Sunday’s re-run of March’s annulled mayoral elections. Erdogan’s candidate Binali Yildirim lost to opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu by nearly 800,000 votes – a humiliating margin of 10 points; and was significant because at the 31 March local election won by Imamoglu, the margin between the two candidates was just over 13,000 votes.
JUN25	Trump's America is in better shape than Brexit Britain. That's why I decided to move	I’m a British Muslim who recently chose Trump’s America over Brexit Britain when I moved to Washington DC. And I don’t regret my decision. Trump's America is in much better shape than Brexit Britain. The US economy and stock market is booming, while the UK is delaying the inevitable crash. 
JUN25	As a queer black man, I want the inevitable obituary of the Buttigieg 2020 campaign to be honest	Pete Buttigieg was always due for a reckoning with black voters. That’s what always made talk of his presidency — at least one set to begin on 20 January 2021 — more hypothetical than plausible. The signs were always there, but his champions never paid much attention. In 2012, a then 29-year-old Buttigieg leaped into controversy a mere 13 weeks into his mayorship of South Bend, Indiana when he fired Darryl Boykins, the city’s first black police chief. Boykins was under scrutiny from federal prosecutors following allegations of improperly taping phone calls of senior white officers said to have used racist language — including about him. No action was taken against the police officers and whatever language was used remains a mystery due to Buttigieg’s refusal to release the tapes. 
JUN25	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper. Substantial areas of the population now have no form of local paper at all.  The industry is suffering inexorable decline. London, the capital city, hub of the nation’s economy, and political and cultural life, is not immune. The Evening Standard was on the cusp of closure under its former owners, and rescued by Evgeny Lebedev. Then, when sales continued to be eroded by the internet, London’s only evening newspaper abandoned its traditional paid-for model and went free. Life for the paper, though, remained a struggle. 
JUN25	Our government has helped state schools offer a genuine challenge to the fee-paying sector	This week a report from the Sutton Trust crossed my desk. Alarmingly, it told me that 65 per cent of serving judges are privately educated, along with 44 per cent of newspaper columnists. I’m concerned that many parents will read this as a reason to start saving up for the fees to pay for private school – but I’m here to tell them they should save their money.  When many of us were young the glaring disparities in our education system meant that parents were often faced with some stark choices: scrape together the money for fees or else accept that the state alternative might not be as good.
JUN25	Zimbabwean President says sale of ivory stocks could fund conservation for 'next 20 years'	Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa has called for multilateral treaties such as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to promote a balance between conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, saying he was “gravely concerned” that the banning of trade of wildlife products was creeping into CITES decision-making processes.  President Mnangagwa, who made the announcement at the inaugural African Wildlife Economy summit 23-25 June in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, said that his country was sitting on $600 million worth of ivory and rhino horn.

JUN25	Black people, gays, Muslims – assemble! I know how we can destroy Boris’s bid for prime minister	The fight to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and our next prime minister has only two contestants left standing: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Clearly neither are fit to lead the country but as only the Tory membership are able to vote the rest of us have to sit in horror as this car crash plays out in slow motion. Many think that Jeremy Hunt is the better of the candidates and this is because they don’t know anything about him. He attended Charterhouse School, an institution that has churned out so many Tories that OFSTED have grounds on which to close it down. He has boasted about his stable family life compared to that of his rival, but also had no idea until recently that his wife was from China not Japan.
JUN25	Boris Johnson making model buses isn't weird. What's weird is not admitting how many children you have	Boris Johnson’s original strategy of winning the Tory leadership contest by placing himself under effective house arrest came unstuck at the weekend when he somehow managed to still cock everything up, from inside the house in which he had arrested himself. But now we are on to Plan B, namely the media blitz, at least we all know why Plan A was the preferred option.
JUN25	Cannabis and heroin tell a painful story about the world's irrational approach to drugs	So often when people think about drugs and those who use them, they conjure up images of “junkies” injecting heroin in the street or young professionals “throwing away” their promising careers because they are “hooked” on cocaine. At the same time, alcohol is seen more as a social lubricant than a substance capable of inflicting significant harm, and tobacco users are not seen in pejorative terms despite the deadly drug they are consuming.  Science is clear, however, that alcohol and tobacco are psychoactive substances with addictive and harmful elements. What separates them in our minds is their legal status, which itself is defined by a flawed assessment process that purports to classify substances according to their potential for harm. In truth this system is broken almost beyond repair.
JUN25	Boris Johnson is letting Iain Duncan Smith run his campaign – we might as well give Hunt the keys to No 10 now	So that’s that, then. Get your money on Jeremy Hunt now. You can still get about 4/1 at the bookies. Surely it’s all over for Boris Johnson. He has committed by far his greatest blunder so far, at least in this leadership contest. He has appointed Iain Duncan Smith as his campaign manager.
JUN26	The Democratic debates are going to be even more ridiculous than you thought	The first Primary debate of the 2020 season is tonight in Miami, some 500 days or so before the election. Staging a debate tonight seems kind of ridiculous — not just because Election Day is so far away, but also because a lengthy democratic process feels out of place in a plutocracy. Lower profile candidates are excited for the debate as it offers them a chance to gain name recognition. Particularly excited to be on stage is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Until now the closest he’d ever come to something staged was a noteworthy WhatsApp conversation with his son. 
JUN26	The people of North Carolina want to talk about their state being used for torture. Do the Democratic candidates?	Will any of the Democratic candidates use the debates tonight and tomorrow to announce plans for countering Islamophobia, white supremacy, and impunity for torture? We hope so — because in the US at the moment, accountability is sorely needed. In North Carolina, community members are currently seeking official recognition of their state’s role in CIA renditions to torture — precisely because they know that only accountability will prevent further enforced disappearances and torture targeting members of marginalized communities, including Muslims.  A groundbreaking citizen-led inquiry panel has determined that the CIA used North Carolina to conduct at least 69 rendition missions.  At least 49 Muslim men and women were abducted and ferried to CIA black sites or foreign proxy prisons using North Carolina-based planes.   
JUN26	How the front line of Brazil’s land rights campaign bleeds into Britain’s climate pledge	Pará state is the epicentre of deforestation and land conflict in the Brazilian Amazon, a biome that also acts as the world’s natural defence against the human actions that are heating up our planet. It is experiencing a deeply worrying moment, and one which should alarm a British government which has committed to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In May we saw the highest rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since current recording methods began, and in January 2019 there was a reported 54 per cent increase in deforestation in the compared with January 2018.
JUN26	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper.

JUN26	The government should set an example for other employers and take MPs’ request for parental leave seriously	We are writing as an alliance of charities and campaigners to express our support for the development of a procedure and the allocation of a budget which would allow all members of parliament to have access to six months parental and adoption leave. Although we appreciate that MPs can make a contingency application for the cost of providing a locum, to cover non-parliamentary chamber duties while on maternity leave, we do not believe this to be a sufficient solution.  
JUN26	I fly more than once a week, and still the excitement of travel is clobbering the climate guilt	I took 67 flights last year. On average, that’s more than one a week. It’s a lot, I know. And I don’t feel guilty about it yet. Flygskam, translated from Swedish as “flight shame”, is this year’s hygge (there’s also smygflyga, which means to take a flight in secret). Flying now seems desperately unfashionable at best, and willfully pig-headed at worst, much to the chagrin of expensive airline marketing campaigns.
JUN26	Boris Johnson talks a lot about being London mayor, but won't discuss his time as foreign secretary – this is why	Boris Johnson talks a lot about his record as London mayor, arguing that it shows he would be a One Nation prime minister. He talks a lot less about his two years as foreign secretary. It’s the most senior position he has held, and yet he didn’t even mention it in the speech launching his Tory leadership campaign. His record at the Foreign Office deserves more scrutiny. In an address to staff when he got the job in 2016, Boris defined their role as “solving problems, doing good,” adding: “Let’s all have some fun while we’re doing it.”
JUN26	Boris Johnson making model buses isn't weird. What's weird is not admitting how many children you have	Boris Johnson’s original strategy of winning the Tory leadership contest by placing himself under effective house arrest came unstuck at the weekend when he somehow managed to still cock everything up, from inside the house in which he had arrested himself. But now we are on to Plan B, namely the media blitz, at least we all know why Plan A was the preferred option.
JUN26	Filming strippers without their consent is no heroic act in the fight for women's rights	There are some campaigners, and particularly some feminists, who seem to believe that in order to achieve a more equal society there are people out there who need saving from themselves. We see it in conversations about black women (”How, exactly, does twerking ‘empower’ us?“); about Muslim women (”Wearing a hijab contributes to your own oppression“); about fat women (”Self-hatred and subscribing to beauty norms is the only way you’ll save yourself“), and about trans women too (”Your personal suffering at the hands of people like me is mythical“). The overarching message is that these women can’t possibly know what’s good for them. They need a self-appointed, morally upstanding woman to tell them what to do – and to silence them in the process.
JUN26	Meesha Shafi is bravely dragging Pakistan towards its own #MeToo moment – and not a moment too soon	Pakistan’s entertainment industry is going through a crisis. Its golden boy, Ali Zafar, has been accused of sexual harassment by Meesha Shafi, a well-known supermodel, actress and singer, who starred in Mira Nair's 2013 film, The Reluctant Fundamentalist. Zafar took the industry by storm in 2003, when he released a music album that sold more than 5 million copies and dominated the airwaves and awards. His fresh-faced, boy-next-door appeal helped him become arguably one of the most prominent celebrities the country has ever produced. He starred in Bollywood films, composed soundtracks for major sporting events, and was the face of global brands.
JUN27	I'm a Mexican doctor with an American wife and I think I know how to improve the US healthcare system	It’s old news that accessing healthcare in the US is a problem for millions of Americans — even Trump has campaigned on making healthcare more affordable.  During last night’s Democratic debates, only two candidates said they would get rid of private health insurance to lessen the US’s healthcare inequality gap: Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio. Such a complex and pressing issue would have benefited from more time for debate. 
JUN27	Even Diane Abbott has split from Corbyn over Brexit – so why won’t he back Remain and save his party?	Jeremy Corbyn surprised some members of his close circle at the shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday by putting off a decision on Labour’s Brexit policy. This was not what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, predicted.  He had told a City audience the day before to expect “white smoke”, and said: “Out of shadow cabinet tomorrow I’m hoping that a more definitive position will emerge.” 
JUN27	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper.

JUN27	IVF clinics are exploiting the desperation of people like me – and there’s no law to stop it	Anyone who has ever tried for a baby will know how all-consuming it can be – especially when it just isn’t happening. I got married when I was 29 and came off the pill shortly after, keen to start a family. After years spent trying not to get pregnant, as I focused on my career and social life, I soon realised just how difficult it could actually be. I was surrounded by friends, colleagues and even strangers on the Tube all proudly displaying their pregnancies, with bulging bellies and “Baby on board” badges. As the months passed and tests revealed I had “unexplained infertility”, I began to feel utterly hopeless. So when my husband and I were finally referred for IVF treatment it felt a bit surreal, but also an incredible relief. The immense pressure of this impossible task wasn’t on my shoulders any more – it was in the safe hands of the experts. I kept my treatment as quiet as possible, keen to protect myself from having to share the disappointing news when it failed. And each time I sat in the hospital waiting room overlooking the rooftops of London, I recognised the desperation on the other patients’ faces all too well.
JUN27	A harrowing image of a failed flight to safety has revealed the consequences of a president’s words	The eye does not want to linger on the image. A father and his daughter, their arms intertwined, lay face down, dead on the banks of the Rio Grande.  Oscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter Valeria, not quite two years of age, died trying to cross the border from Mexico to the United States. Or, to put it more accurately, from desperation to freedom. They had arrived at the border from El Salvador and, like so many others, were travelling through Mexico in order to claim asylum in America, to which they had a right. Faced with the squalid conditions in a refugee camp on the Mexican side of the river, they took their chances.
JUN27	The government should set an example for other employers and take MPs’ request for parental leave seriously	We are writing as an alliance of charities and campaigners to express our support for the development of a procedure and the allocation of a budget which would allow all members of parliament to have access to six months parental and adoption leave. Although we appreciate that MPs can make a contingency application for the cost of providing a locum, to cover non-parliamentary chamber duties while on maternity leave, we do not believe this to be a sufficient solution.  
JUN27	How the Tories became a Brexit death cult in thrall to Boris Johnson	Has the Conservative Party become a death cult? A few years ago that would not have been a question that it would have occurred to anyone even to ask. But after the publication of YouGov’s most recent polling of its grassroots members, it’s one that’s hard to ignore. Some 61 per cent were willing to countenance significant economic damage to the British economy in order to leave the EU. And 63 per cent and 59 per cent of members were apparently content to see Scotland or Northern Ireland leaving the UK if that is what it took to get Brexit.
JUN27	The people of the Middle East should be reassured by one thing – their autocrats are no longer a global anomaly	President Hassan Rouhani of Iran got it right on Tuesday. He said that the White House is “afflicted by mental retardation and doesn’t know what to do”. Donald Trump’s new sanctions may not be as “outrageous and idiotic” as Rouhani claims, but we’ve now reached a stage where the American president’s mental incapacity is plain for all to see. It is a sign of the times – our times, I’m afraid – that all the rantings and ravings of Iran’s leaders over the past 40 years at last sound clear cut, true, absolutely on the cue. Trump is crackers, barmy, off the wall, categorically lunatic.
JUN27	Boris Johnson is still lying, and still no one cares	It’s a war of attrition now, as futile and pointless as it is grinding and desperate. All hope of gaining ground is gone, but we are still compelled to defend our territory or else lose it. And so, with our hearts longing for impending death, we must return to our positions once more. There’s been another round of Tory leadership hustings. Boris Johnson’s position on Brexit is still meaningless garbage. He still wants to “disaggregate bits of the withdrawal agreement”. He still wants to deal with the Irish border question “during the implementation period”, all the while continuing to have “frictionless trade” with the European Union.
JUN27	Boris Johnson becoming prime minister would be humiliating for Britain	No doubt about it now. Boris is out and about and we see him for the bumbling, forgetful buffoon we have always known him to be. His backroom team and MP supporters must be having a collective nervous breakdown. Well serves them right. They are backing him solely for his populist appeal, hoping they can control and guide him away from car crash interviews and poisoned soundbites to further their own careers and political agendas. The parallel with Trump and the Republican Party is obvious. My God! Is this really happening in good old Blighty?! On a brighter note, I haven’t laughed so much for ages. Please, please, please can someone get him to do a show-and-tell with his painted wine crate buses of people having a happy time. That would certainly make me happy. A do or die Brexit, Boris? Do me a favour!
JUN28	Some people in the Democratic debates wanted to change things. Some wanted to clean up a murder scene with a Lysol wipe	Over the past two nights of Democratic debates among 20 candidates, a key question has been introduced to this clown car of a primary, namely: Do we want “big, structural change” — as Elizabeth Warren put it, setting the tone on Wednesday evening — or would we rather go back to the way things were before?  All of the candidates are united in their belief that Democrats need to defeat Trump in 2020, but they differ on the reason why. The essential question is whether Trump is a one-off disaster that can be removed from the White House like hazardous waste, or simply the most grotesque symptom of the greed that is ailing our democracy. It’s a matter of whether Americans want to overthrow the status quo in pursuit of a truer, more equitable society, or tinker around with the great American dumpster fire, salvaging whatever hasn’t been gobbled up in flames. 
JUN28	Why Vladimir Putin is trying to drag his ‘death of liberalism’ narrative onto the global stage	"Time is running out for liberalism". That is the key message the Kremlin has fed to Russian citizens over the last decade.  After being daily bombarded with images portraying the decline and decay of the liberal West, recent opinion polls conducted by the Levada centre have highlighted that most Russians embrace conservative values. With a deep sense of surprise many analysts ponder, where are all the liberals of the 1980s and 1990s that signed off on the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War? Such is the magnitude of the shift to traditional values that Vladimir Putin’s presidency managed to achieve.
JUN28	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper. Substantial areas of the population now have no form of local paper at all.  The industry is suffering inexorable decline. London, the capital city, hub of the nation’s economy, and political and cultural life, is not immune. The Evening Standard was on the cusp of closure under its former owners, and rescued by Evgeny Lebedev. Then, when sales continued to be eroded by the internet, London’s only evening newspaper abandoned its traditional paid-for model and went free. Life for the paper, though, remained a struggle. 
JUN28	The Top 10: Things that won’t happen until after Brexit	Sebastian Bacon suggested this list when the prime minister said that she would resign as soon as we left the EU. At the time, we were told David Cameron wouldn’t be publishing his memoir until afterwards, so that it wouldn’t disrupt the negotiations, and John Bercow said he would postpone his retirement as speaker of the House of Commons until Brexit was resolved.  Theresa May has since announced her resignation and Cameron’s book is coming out on 19 September, but the speaker goes on and on and on. 
JUN28	State schools are becoming fundraising machines fuelled by homemade croquembouche and shabby-chic fairy cakes	There is a guilt that gnaws at me as I drop my children off at school. Sometimes it strikes as I scroll down my WhatsApp groups, past the swarms of parents frantically rallying the troops for the latest school fundraising effort. “Bake a cake!” they cry amid a scatter of earnestly imploring emojis. Sadly, the nature of my work means that I can rarely do much to help, as I often gig at night and then spend the day writing. While the more domestically organised of my friends are rocking up to the trestle table with a 9ft croquembouche, I have been known to buy fairy cakes from the supermarket and spend 15 minutes duffing them up to look a bit more plausibly homemade.

JUN28	A Brexit coup against Tory ‘traitors’ is sharpening the knives tonight for its latest victim	Anyone in any doubt that there is a concerted attempt by Brexit extremists to take over the Conservative party should toddle along to the Leave.EU website. There you will find these full instructions on deselecting Tory MPs you don’t care for. Under the heading “DESELECT THE TORY TRAITORS. THE TIME IS NOW. WHO’S NEXT?” you will be invited to fill in a form giving your contact details, (consenting for them to be shared), your membership number and when you joined:
JUN28	The story of the Stonewall riots shows Pride isn’t a part of ‘snowflake’ culture – it’s a radical call for justice	It’s been 50 years since the fateful summer of 1969, when in the early hours of 28 June New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in the heart of Manhattan’s Greenwich Village, leading to an unexpected act of defiance. What began as yet another in a long string of humiliating busts on queer spaces throughout the country, ultimately concluded in a set of riots which would forever change history’s course. The uprisings provided an unprecedented sense of community and agency to a then-fledgling LGBT+ movement, marking the transition from early “homophile” groups to the out-and-proud Gay Liberation Front and pride marches held throughout the western world. All of this has led to the Stonewall riots being cherished as an emblematic part of LGBT+ history, the reason why Pride month is globally celebrated in June. And yet, as we commemorate their golden anniversary today, there’s a crucial part of the story which is constantly left out.
JUN28	I fact-checked Naomi Wolf's new book on gay rights – the mockery she has faced for one error disguises the real outrage we should feel	For a month, critics have attacked Naomi Wolf’s new book, Outrages: Sex, Censorship and the Criminalization of Love, which explores how 19th-century UK laws persecuted homosexuality around the world and fuelled the gay rights movement. A BBC radio host pointed out on 21 May that the phrase “death recorded” did not mean that a number of the death sentence prisoners that Wolf had cited had been executed. A social media and news story furore followed.  But surely we should be reckoning with a dark aspect of British colonial history which Wolf investigates, rather than let ourselves be distracted by this uproar?
JUN28	The DWP’s muddled maths is sending universal credit deeper into meltdown	“I am delighted to announce the introduction of the universal credit,” said Iain Duncan Smith at the Conservative Party conference on 5 October 2010. “[It] will, I believe, restore fairness and simplicity to a complex, outdated and wildly expensive benefits system. A real time system which will also help cut the cost of fraud and error.” It may come as a surprise, then, that nine years on, the government’s spending watchdog has revealed that fraud and error in the welfare bill are at their highest levels since 2006 – with much of the rise down to the introduction of universal credit.
JUN29	Stormzy’s Glastonbury set was a masterpiece in throwing shade at politicians – and Boris deserved all he got	Glastonbury might be bathing in hot sunlight but there were snowflakes in the homes of right-wingers who chose to watch the BBC’s coverage of Stormzy’s set. The grime superstar was Friday’s Pyramid Stage headliner, and treated viewers to a blistering and politically charged performance including, of course, “Vossi Bop”, his No 1 single which features the lyric “F*** the government and f*** Boris”.
JUN29	Armed Forces Day is a propaganda tool for arms firms and the military – and the public are footing the bill	Today marks the 10th year of Armed Forces Day with the main event held in Salisbury. Styled as family friendly, the National Armed Forces Day event, and others around the country, feature militarised activities designed for children and young people. In between the ice creams and rides, kids are able to try on military uniform and can be shown how real (albeit deactivated) machine guns and other weapons work. Yet despite the fairground veneer to the proceedings, the event’s origins point to a much darker story. Founded by Gordon Brown – and replacing what had been Veteran’s Day – Armed Forces Day was one strand of a package of proposals put together to re-militarise British society in a bid to stave off the popular backlash from failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, lest anti-war sentiment hinder future conflicts.  
JUN29	The government should be supporting the British press, not creating new funding problems	Hardly a week goes by in Britain without the closure of a newspaper.

JUN29	Mea Culpa: Switch this cliche off and switch it on again	We rebooted things several times this week, from Doctor Who to the Isle of Wight music festival. The word ought to be banned, except when applied to a computer or phone, when it means switching it off and switching it on again, which is the cure for 95 per cent of all problems.  When Russell T Davies revived Doctor Who, for example, he did not start again with an empty random-access memory: he drew on the rich history and mythology of the programme and did something brilliant with it. 
JUN29	It’s official: Stormzy is a phenomenon and black British culture is flying	Gun fingers sway on a darkened stage in front of 100,000 festival goers, shown on TV to millions more, as Stormzy stands tall, embodying the heights that grime culture has reached. Donning body armour designed with a blackened union jack, Stormzy’s performance was heavy on the references to the fact that – against all odds – he was even there in the first place. With the stage’s screens flashing up with the areas he’s from as he performed “Know Me From” – South Norwood, Thornton Heath, West Norwood, Croydon, Selhurst, Norbury – Stormzy wanted everybody to know what he represents. To start his set, he showed a clip of himself discussing the performance with Jay-Z, a key inspiration for him. “Culture moves the whole world,” stated the American rapper. Well Stormzy’s performance last night did just that.
JUN29	Horrific pictures of drowned migrants should not distract us from the fact that far more people die on EU borders	Four years ago, I was standing by the grave of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old child who drowned when the rubber boat carrying him and his Syrian Kurdish family from Turkey to Greece was flipped over by high waves. The picture of his small body in a red shirt and black shorts lying face down on a Turkish beach with his head in the surf was supposed to have focused public attention on the hideous plight of refugees in the Mediterranean. Alan’s grave was an ugly stone rectangle in a cemetery beside the ruins of the Kurdish city of Kobani in northern Syria which Isis had ferociously assaulted and nearly captured in a prolonged siege in 2014-15. I found the scene all the more moving because there were no flowers and Alan’s little grave was surrounded by fresh earth gouged out by a bulldozer preparing the ground for more graves.
JUN29	We already have the best deal – it’s staying inside the EU	The good news is we’re part of the largest trading bloc in history which took 20 years to negotiate – integrating 800 million people and a quarter of the world’s GDP. The bad news is we’re on course to lose it all in October. Not only are we now likely to leave the EU without a deal; a ridiculous idea has taken hold that existing EU trading deals with over 60 countries might just be handed to us on a plate. And there’s an even more ridiculous idea floated in extremist Conservative circles that we might improve upon deals decades in the making. What irony that our likely next PM’s understanding of Greek tragedy so dwarfs his understanding of global trade.
JUN29	There were five Democrats who came out of the debates looking properly presidential	The Democratic presidential debates the past two nights were humanizing for the 24 people vying for the nomination. They were no longer just names associated with controversies or soundbites: on the stage Wednesday and Thursday night, the candidates transformed into people with voices and experiences for Americans watching intently from their homes.  Some surprising leaders emerged. 
JUN30	The next step to fighting FGM is targeting the women ‘surgeons’ – they need to understand the terrible consequences of being cut	Across the world, 68 million girls are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM). In Nigeria, almost 15 million are at risk of FGM according to surveys. Although there has been progress in recent years in raising awareness about FGM, the next step is directly addressing the “surgeons” – the perpetrators – of this practice, and teach them why they should say “no” in future.
JUN30	The gig economy is not intrinsically a bad thing. In fact, it’s given many of us a great opportunity	In many people’s minds, the phrase “gig economy” is synonymous with everything that is wrong with 2019, along with zero hour contracts, austerity, gentrification and, of course, avocados. Characterised by short-term contracts, often facilitated by technology, the gig economy has more than doubled in the last three years. For many this is a sign of the increasingly insecure nature of work and irresponsible employees. But for me, and many gig economy workers like me, this hasn’t been the full story.
JUN30	Armed Forces Day is a propaganda tool for arms firms and the military – and the public are footing the bill	Today marks the 10th year of Armed Forces Day with the main event held in Salisbury.

JUN30	Communities living with wildlife demand they be the rightful owners	Communities living with wildlife are seeking a new model for conservation that places them as the primary guardians of the natural resources at their front door and allows them to reap the benefits generated from them. In a declaration presented to heads of state, private investors and international organisations at the African Wildlife Economy Summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, 40 community groups from 12 African countries asked for a new agreement that places them as shareholders of the resources on their land. At present, communities shoulder the costs of living with wildlife, such as crop raids and sometimes human life, with little or no compensation. 
JUN30	Africa must protect its natural wonders if the continent is to prosper	Wildlife, and biodiversity in general, is the future of Africa’s development and realisation of the continent’s Agenda 2063. The prosperity of countries and continents lies in the conservation of ecosystems and genetic materials, as these resources are getting scarce and those who will preserve them stand to charge more for their access.  Africa still holds a wealth of wildlife species, making it one of the leading continents in some of the big mammals. The continent’s rich diversity of fauna and flora represents about a quarter of the global biodiversity.

JUL1	Ivanka Trump’s behaviour at the G20 is only acceptable if she’s playing a secret feminist takeover long game	From AOC to Christine Lagarde, everyone seems to be wondering what exactly Ivanka Trump is doing at the G20 summit. In case you haven’t encountered the video evidence already, the Elysee Palace released a short, painful clip yesterday of the First Daughter attempting to make social justice chit-chat with Lagarde, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau.  Prime Minister May says something about convincing people to support social justice by approaching the issue with economic arguments, at which point Ivanka decides to jump in. “It’s the same with the defence side,” she says. “In terms of the whole ecosystem, it’s very male-dominated.” It doesn’t make a huge amount of sense as a sentence, but why should it? It’s not like that’s a requisite of the Trump school of politics.
JUL1	My family opened the first Japanese American concentration camp — that's why I know AOC is right about the southern border	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right to call out what's happening in our southern border camps. I would know — because someone in my family opened the first Japanese American concentration camp in the United States.  Like so many parents of children of color, the day Donald Trump's election washed over a shocked America, I woke up dreading telling my nine-year-old Muslim son. When he heard the news of Trump's election, my son pleaded, "We have to plan our escape before Trump takes office and puts us into Muslim camps. Please, Mama." That heartbreaking conversation led me to the revelation that my great-great uncle, Clayton Triggs, was the first director of Manzanar, the US's first concentration camp for Japanese Americans during the Second World War.
JUL1	No, accused rapists should absolutely not be given anonymity – this is why	Cliff Richard, Stephen Fry, DJ Paul Gambaccini are amongst other male celebrities campaigning for anonymity for suspects in sexual offences cases. The group called Fair (Falsely Accused Individuals for Reform) has launched a parliamentary petition today calling for those suspected of sexual offences to be given anonymity until they are charged unless there are exceptional circumstances. Once 100,000 signatures are reached, parliament will consider whether to debate the issue.  The campaign is peddling false and dangerous myths that complainants (the majority of whom are women) lie about rape. DJ Paul Gambaccini warns of a “false allegation crisis” and that the current law encourages “everyone from liars to lunatics to make some false accusations and get in on the action”.
JUL1	England’s schools have reached crisis point, with DfE policies and Ofsted’s inspection methods the culprit	With reference to your report on four in five schools losing their “outstanding” grade on re-inspection, Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman predictably responds that Ofsted must inspect more frequently, rather than critically interrogating the inspection regime itself. Far from being an objective observer, Ofsted’s very existence and ideology actively create much of what it then has the gall to criticise. Under its low-trust surveillance regime and the fear-driven survival mentality that it generates, Ofsted drives schools into outcomes-driven “teaching to the test” and ticking all the unspeakably time and resources-consuming institutional boxes beloved of bean-counter bureaucrats, in order to meet its insultingly simplistic grading system – only then for schools to be criticised by Ofsted for doing just this!
JUL1	In this climate of violence, women-only events are needed more than ever	I had never experienced such pure joy on a night out until the day I attended my first women-only event. Last year, I attended Black Femme Film, an organisation run by five women that aims to promote diversity and inclusion within the film industry.
JUL1	Communities living with wildlife demand they be the rightful owners	Communities living with wildlife are seeking a new model for conservation that places them as the primary guardians of the natural resources at their front door and allows them to reap the benefits generated from them.

JUL1	Not Johnson, Farage or Corbyn: This is the one man doing more than anyone to make Brexit happen	Who is it, do you think, in our public life who is doing the most to ensure that Brexit happens? Nigel Farage? Arron Banks? Emmanuel Macron (covertly)? Boris Johnson? Jeremy Hunt? Jeremy Clarkson? Jeremy Corbyn?
JUL1	Jeremy Hunt has stopped caring which side of history he is on, as long as he is the face of it	If we may begin on a personal note, the wall-to-wall Glastonbury coverage over the weekend will not have rendered this particular mid-to-late-thirties political sketch writer alone in yearning for younger days. But little could I have known that nothing could transport one back with quite such terrifying potency as having to listen to Jeremy Hunt laying out his plan for no-deal Brexit, an event that could have easily taken place in the Worthy Farm chemical toilets compound at the peak of the morning rush. An unmistakeable smell has punctuated this Tory leadership contest, but never before has the air been quite so thick with it.
JUL1	The EU’s new trade deal with South America will put ‘global Britain’ to shame	A recent piece of news that largely passed under the radar, such is the UK’s Brexit obsession, was the fact that the EU and South American economic bloc Mercosur has clinched a huge trade deal after 20 years of negotiations. It is the EU’s biggest deal to date and aims to cut or remove trade tariffs, making imported products cheaper for consumers while also boosting exports for companies on both sides.
JUL1	By strolling into the DMZ with Kim, has Donald Trump saddled us with a nuclear North Korea?	They came. They shook hands. Then one of them retreated Donald Trump has secured his latest photo opportunity with his “good friend”, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He can say that he is the first US president to take a step – 20 of them in fact – inside North Korea.
JUL2	The right want to make the Andy Ngo Antifa violence a reason to stop confronting fascists. Don't ever let it happen	Right now, much of the online ecosphere of the far right is abuzz with the news that right-wing Quilette editor and journalist, Andy Ngo, was allegedly attacked by “Antifa” at a protest in Portland, Oregon, resulting in a suspected brain bleed. In fact, the news has filtered through to the cable networks. Even figures in the UK, such as Toby Young have railed against the re-emergence of a supposed radicalised, violent Antifa attacking those they disagree with.
JUL2	Sudan's rising strongman has a fragile grip on the military – and a bloody civil war looms	 Sudan remains locked in standoff that risks a third, and grislier, military coup. The conflict, on the face of it, is simple. The military and its associated paramilitary forces are resolved to thwart the people’s ambitions to establish civilian democratic rule. But there is more to it than that.
JUL2	England’s schools have reached crisis point, with DfE policies and Ofsted’s inspection methods the culprit	With reference to your report on four in five schools losing their “outstanding” grade on re-inspection, Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman predictably responds that Ofsted must inspect more frequently, rather than critically interrogating the inspection regime itself.

JUL2	Wildlife Economies Summit ends with new commitments to nature-based tourism	Gabon and Zimbabwe this week announced their commitment to attracting more tourists to their national parks through securing investment that will help support wildfire protection and the local communities. The proposals were announced at the close of the African Union and UN Environment Africa Wildlife Economy Summit in Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, attended by the presidents of Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, and Namibia, and ministerial delegations from more than 12 African countries.
JUL2	The government should set an example for other employers and take MPs’ request for parental leave seriously	We are writing as an alliance of charities and campaigners to express our support for the development of a procedure and the allocation of a budget which would allow all members of parliament to have access to six months parental and adoption leave. Although we appreciate that MPs can make a contingency application for the cost of providing a locum, to cover non-parliamentary chamber duties while on maternity leave, we do not believe this to be a sufficient solution.  
JUL2	The Top 10: Things that won’t happen until after Brexit	Sebastian Bacon suggested this list when the prime minister said that she would resign as soon as we left the EU. At the time, we were told David Cameron wouldn’t be publishing his memoir until afterwards, so that it wouldn’t disrupt the negotiations, and John Bercow said he would postpone his retirement as speaker of the House of Commons until Brexit was resolved.  Theresa May has since announced her resignation and Cameron’s book is coming out on 19 September, but the speaker goes on and on and on. 
JUL2	Ivanka Trump’s behaviour at the G20 is only acceptable if she’s playing a secret feminist takeover long game	From AOC to Christine Lagarde, everyone seems to be wondering what exactly Ivanka Trump is doing at the G20 summit. In case you haven’t encountered the video evidence already, the Elysee Palace released a short, painful clip yesterday of the First Daughter attempting to make social justice chit-chat with Lagarde, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau.  Prime Minister May says something about convincing people to support social justice by approaching the issue with economic arguments, at which point Ivanka decides to jump in. “It’s the same with the defence side,” she says. “In terms of the whole ecosystem, it’s very male-dominated.” It doesn’t make a huge amount of sense as a sentence, but why should it? It’s not like that’s a requisite of the Trump school of politics.
JUL2	As Hong Kong protests turn violent, has China just been handed the excuse for a crackdown?	On Sunday morning, the Hong Kong establishment celebrated the anniversary of the former British colony’s return to the motherland. It was indoors, the public weren’t allowed to observe and it seemed that every effort was made to stop protesters turning it into an embarrassment. It didn’t go as planned. The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong is growing resilient, and its young members are growing angry and frustrated. All their demands have been rejected, including the two that form the basis of this protest: a clear-cut withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent investigation into the alleged police violence on 12 June.
JUL2	‘Rapid and real change’? The BBC’s pay gap shows women in the media are still underappreciated	The BBC was rightly criticised last year when it emerged that its top 12 highest earners were all men. Director-general Tony Hall had said the BBC was “making progress” and that “these things take time”, but a less diplomatic assessment was given by Jane Garvey of Woman’s Hour.  She told BBC Radio 4 that the pace of change was “absolutely glacial”. 
JUL2	Theresa May, the only way you’ll secure a legacy is by saving us from no-deal Brexit	Dear Prime Minister,  You have had a tough couple of years.
JUL3	This week I'll celebrate my first Independence Day as a full American citizen. The problem is I'm also British	Tomorrow will be my first Fourth of July as an American citizen. But since I’m also a British citizen, I’m tempted to show up to work tomorrow as an act of protest — at least for a half day.  American independence is a confounding subject for me; partly because, as a Brit, I have no idea what emotions to channel in a celebration of independence. And partly because the Fourth of July is an ironic holiday, not least because Thomas Jefferson — who wrote “all men are created equal” in the Declaration of Independence — was a slave owner.
JUL3	Because of what Trump has done, I'll be celebrating the Fourth of July very differently this year	Lady Liberty is weeping. That’s one sentence that I’ve been saying a lot lately and even more so as we near the Fourth of July holiday this week. The festive decorations have lined store shelves for weeks, where streamers and banners have proclaimed “Happy Fourth of July” in huge lettering. You can’t miss it even if you tried. But “happy"? Really?
JUL3	Republicans are leading efforts to curtail black votes in 2020. This Independence Day, ask yourself if that means 'liberty and justice for all'	As Fourth of July celebrations take place across the United States, we should not lose sight of the persistent challenges facing black Americans. If the fireworks are meant to commemorate “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” then the continued efforts to curtail voting rights serve as a bitter reminder that these ideals remain elusive for many. Since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Right Act, which upheld African Americans’ right to vote as guaranteed by the 15th amendment of the US constitution, a number of state and local laws have worked in tandem to chip away at these rights. A recent Florida law, which denies the right to vote to individuals with a past felony conviction who owe money to the state, is no exception. 
JUL3	Outsourcing giant Serco committed fraud on a mass scale – and yet it's still propping up the state	Let’s say you run a small plumbing firm and you’ve been charging your local council for fixing 100 toilets a month when you have in fact fixed 80. Let’s say this you’ve been running this fiddle for three years. What do you think the consequence would be if it were to come to light through things getting unpleasant in the bathrooms of several tenants? In all likelihood your business would be toast. It would probably never work for another local council, or anyone else. Nor would you, unless you were to be sent to a prison where the governor thought he could make use of your skills to get the pipes fixed on the cheap. 
JUL3	Kim Kardashian’s ‘Kimono’ and Nike’s Betsy Ross sneakers aren’t the first marketing fails – but they should be the last	Within days of announcing her new “Kimono” shapewear line to great backlash, Kim Kardashian has done a complete U-turn and announced her intentions to rename the brand.  From the off, the line, which does not feature anything resembling the traditional Japanese dress, drew claims of cultural appropriation on social media, with criticism of what many interpreted as blatant disregard for Japanese history and tradition. 
JUL3	England’s schools have reached crisis point, with DfE policies and Ofsted’s inspection methods the culprit	With reference to your report on four in five schools losing their “outstanding” grade on re-inspection, Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman predictably responds that Ofsted must inspect more frequently, rather than critically interrogating the inspection regime itself. Far from being an objective observer, Ofsted’s very existence and ideology actively create much of what it then has the gall to criticise. Under its low-trust surveillance regime and the fear-driven survival mentality that it generates, Ofsted drives schools into outcomes-driven “teaching to the test” and ticking all the unspeakably time and resources-consuming institutional boxes beloved of bean-counter bureaucrats, in order to meet its insultingly simplistic grading system – only then for schools to be criticised by Ofsted for doing just this!
JUL3	Jeremy Hunt’s appalling turn as foreign secretary tells you everything you need to know about him as PM	For Liberal Democrats, the political choice between the hard Brexit menus offered by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt might seem about as tempting as arsenic verses strychnine. Some might believe Hunt’s offer is less poisonous, but for British business the choice is still between Johnson’s decidedly strange strategy or Hunt’s willingness to close small businesses down, all for the sheer deranged machismo of Brexit. And you know what? I’m starting to wonder if Hunt might indeed be the worse choice.
JUL3	No, Jeremy Hunt, the rest of the world isn’t telling you to have the ‘courage’ to get on with Brexit	Not since David Blaine starved himself in a Perspex box over Tower Bridge for 44 days has the nation witnessed an endurance event quite like the Tory leadership contest, though it is far from clear whether it is us, or them, doing the enduring. It is, quite incredibly, only Day 13 of Hunt vs Johnson, less than halfway, which is perhaps too early for Jeremy Hunt’s eat-sleep-bollocks-repeat spin cycle to have come full circle. From amusingly ridiculous to borderline unsettling, and all the way back to ridiculous again, becoming perhaps the world’s first political campaign to double as a performance art homage to Alan Partridge repeatedly shouting “Dan!” in a hotel car park.
JUL3	The Brexit Party’s protest of the EU anthem made Britain look like an even bigger joke	I was mortified to see the Brexit Party MEPs turn their backs when the European anthem was played. This was very offensive and will have made millions of British people cringe with embarrassment.  One wonders what these same MEPs’ reaction would have been had backs turned during the playing of our own national anthem.
JUL3	Depriving children of access to LGBT-inclusive sex education isn’t protective – it’s destructive	Back in February, the UK government published draft statutory guidance on Relationships education and Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) and health education, which means that from September 2020, all will become compulsory in all UK schools. Although the move is welcomed by many, analysis of the guidance document could be seen as biased towards specific types of relationships, as echoed in numerous attempts to restrict LGBT+-inclusive lessons in schools.  Several references promote the benefits of marriage, “committed, stable relationships”, “healthy one-to-one intimate relationships”, and a recommendation that marriage and its special legal place is taught from primary age. Which, on the surface, sounds harmless enough. But it’s important to note that the guidance both explicitly and implicitly places marriage above other forms of relationships – which needs challenging.
JUL4	How The Independent sparked genuine cross-party work to help disabled people on public transport	Since I returned to work after getting run over by a cement truck, The Independent has afforded me the opportunity to chronicle my own and others’ unpleasant experiences on public transport as mobility impaired people. MIPs in London Underground-speak.  There has been a lot to write about: a gruesome series of columns involving embarrassment, humiliation, sometimes even pain. 
JUL4	Jared Kushner should be ignored – but we should remember this startling US Middle East plan from 100 years ago	Almost exactly a hundred years ago, the president of the United States was searching for a “deal of the century” in the Middle East. Christian academic Henry King, of Oberlin College, was no Jared Kushner. Neither he nor the industrialist Charles Crane, whose family got rich making toilets in Chicago, were sons-in-law of the American president. But Woodrow Wilson sent them on an ambitious 1919 tour across the ruins of the Ottoman Empire to find out what could be done for the Muslim and Christian Arabs and the Jews of the Middle East – and the Turks and the Armenians and the Greeks.  A hundred years ago, they reported back to Washington with a series of recommendations which would cast dark shadows for us, even today.
JUL4	Who trusts opinion polls any more? I do	One of the joys of Twitter is the predictability of the responses whenever I post an opinion poll. “You don’t still believe polls any more, do you?” I am asked. Well, yes, actually, I do.  You have to interpret them with care, but they are better than any other way of judging public opinion. Voting intention polls do not tell us much at the moment about what would happen if there were an early general election, because that would depend so much on when such an election took place and why it was called.
JUL4	Druggie zombie junkies, and the language battle at the heart of our attitudes towards addiction	Confidence and self-belief are fragile states. For most of us they can either be nurtured or destroyed by the way others describe us. So consider for a moment what terms like “junkie”, “crack-head” or “zombie” do for the self-esteem of people who develop problems with drugs.  Even the less colloquial phrases – like drug-abuser and getting clean (or dirty) – are loaded with judgement. It would be unheard of describe a person with diabetes as having “dirty” blood results but this description is still used for positive drug tests.
JUL4	Outsourcing giant Serco committed fraud on a mass scale – and yet it's still propping up the state	Let’s say you run a small plumbing firm and you’ve been charging your local council for fixing 100 toilets a month when you have in fact fixed 80. Let’s say this you’ve been running this fiddle for three years. What do you think the consequence would be if it were to come to light through things getting unpleasant in the bathrooms of several tenants? In all likelihood your business would be toast. It would probably never work for another local council, or anyone else. Nor would you, unless you were to be sent to a prison where the governor thought he could make use of your skills to get the pipes fixed on the cheap.

It is, quite incredibly, only Day 13 of Hunt vs Johnson, less than halfway, which is perhaps too early for Jeremy Hunt’s eat-sleep-bollocks-repeat spin cycle to have come full circle.

JUL4	I used to weigh 25 stone, but the responsibility for tackling the obesity crisis is yours as much as mine	I used to weigh 25 and a half stone. Thanks to weight loss surgery and the Slimming World programme, I am now around 13 stone – and aiming to make it to 10 and a half. In my old life, I couldn’t walk 100 metres without crippling back pain. Last month I hiked 25km for charity, and up some pretty steep hills too. I have gone from being morbidly obese to obese. Soon, I hope, I will just be overweight.
JUL4	The Lib Dem ‘Stop Brexit’ campaign will actually work – so what if it ruffled a few feathers at EU parliament?	At the constitutive meeting of MEPs in the French City of Strasbourg yesterday, I proudly donned a yellow t-shirt emblazoned with “Stop Brexit” on the front and “Bollocks to Brexit" on my back. Cheered by many passers by, we marched together into the chamber of European democracy, the plenary of the European parliament. Ninety-five days after the UK was supposed to leave the EU, I proudly put my voting card into use, on behalf of the Londoners who voted for me to represent them in Europe. Unlike the Brexit Party, who childishly turned their backs during a recital of the European anthem, I stood proud in the belief that there is no contradiction between my identities. I am a Londoner, I am a proud Brit and I am a European. No one, least of all Nigel Farage and his band of speculators and vulture capitalists, will make me choose between them. 
JUL4	Just like his position on Brexit, Jeremy Hunt’s ever-changing stance on fox hunting is not to be trusted	I was interested to read that Jeremy Hunt has changed his mind within hours of announcing his pledge to bring back fox hunting if he becomes our next prime minister.  “It is part of our countryside”, he first explained. Is this not utter hypocrisy versus his stance on not offering a second referendum on leaving the EU, due to it being deemed undemocratic to hold a second vote on something already “decided”? 
JUL5	The EU’s scurrilous anti-democratic dealings prove once again that it is beyond reform	There is only one positive thing that could be said about the recent top EU appointments: the crucial posts went to women. Germany’s defence minister Ursula von der Leyen will be the next European Commission president, while Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF and former French finance minister, will lead the ECB. If parliament approves their nominations, the EU will gain points in gender representation. And that is it. With the exception of Lagarde, all appointees are political mediocrities and international unknowns, while some are even tainted with scandals. Suffice it to list the others: Charles Michel, Belgium’s prime minister, who will become president of the European Council; Josep Borrell, Spain’s foreign minister, who will become the head of EU foreign policy; and David Sassoli, an Italian MEP, who will become president of the European parliament.
JUL5	I’ve marched at Pride for decades – don’t let anyone tell you we don’t still need it today	They say you never forget your first Pride. I certainly haven’t forgotten mine, when two impossibly beautiful young guys in bondage gear ran up to me to declare that “you have the best hair at Pride!” At 19 (in the days before the advent of useful hair products) I had thick black curls all the way down to my waist that I’d spend hours scrunch-drying. It was wonderful to get some appreciation for my efforts from people who wouldn’t look out of place in a My Little Pony-themed S&M dungeon.
JUL5	Elephants are more than just the trade in ivory	Of the 36,000 species falling under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trade controls there is one that has been the proverbial elephant in the room. An often-heated debate has raged on for decades at CITES tri-annual conferences over trade in the ivory of the African elephant, with a ban on commercial trade agreed in 1989, followed by decisions allowing two ‘one off’ sales of certain ivory stockpiles in 1999 and 2008. After a short respite in Bangkok in 2013, when CITES Parties agreed to focus on the immediate threat posed by the surge in poaching of elephants for their ivory, the debate resumed in Johannesburg in 2016 and is set to continue in Geneva in August of this year at the next CITES conference.
JUL5	Conservation must work for communities	Everyone wants to save the rainforest, don’t they? Of course, most people do, but if you live in a rural African village there are other more pressing priorities of an immediate nature. Protecting the environment won’t be too high on the list. Last week, I spoke at the UN Africa Wildlife Economy Summit at Victoria Falls and it brought  home to me that the people who really need to care about the rainforest are the ones with the means and influence to ensure it works for local people too.  
JUL5	The Top 10: Lyrics That Became Popular Sayings	Phil Riley started this one by noting references to a “Hotel California” Brexit – “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” A lot of good nominations this week, so I made it a Top 20.  1. You can’t always get what you want. Rolling Stones. Nominated by Patrick Hennessy, John Peters, Harriet Marsden and Tim Hailstone. 
JUL5	We’ve all heard of a green new deal. But this is what it will actually look like	Climate breakdown is already here, it is just unevenly distributed. From extreme weather events to rising seas, from collapsing biodiversity and soil erosion, the effects are already devastating many communities, livelihoods, and ecosystems, particularly those in the global south. Yet unless we begin rapidly and radically decarbonising the global economy in the next decade,  we all but guarantee rising temperatures and the acceleration of accelerating and interconnected forms of natural systems breakdown.
JUL5	As a black gay man, I won’t be marching at Pride this year – here’s why	It’s the time of year when the streets of central London are fluttering with rainbow flags for Pride, but despite the great weather, many like me won’t be joining the parade. As a black gay man, I’ve just never felt part of it. Pride in London claims this year will be its “most diverse” parade yet, though historically Prides have excluded diverse voices from within the LGBT+ community – the very people the movement was created to uplift. This is one reason that UK Black Pride throws its own celebration the day after, specifically for people of colour.
JUL5	As  Amazon turns 25, let’s call time on the tech oligarchy and their dystopian ‘disruptions’ to our lives	Twenty-five years ago today, a man called Jeff founded an online marketplace for books. Since then, Amazon’s scale and influence has grown faster than anyone could have expected at the time. When we think about Amazon today, most of us are familiar with the convenient online shopping, the quick deliveries, maybe the streaming service.
JUL5	Ann Widdecombe’s comments about Britain being a colony are utterly shameful	I see Ann Widdecombe made a speech in the European parliament yesterday comparing Britons to slaves under their EU masters. She’s right, it’s exactly the same. As one of the slaves she speaks so eloquently about she clearly realises that being democratically elected to a parliament, and being paid nearly €9,000 (£8,100) to be there plus expenses is exactly the same as being taken 3000 miles across the Atlantic and forced to work in cotton fields in the American colonies. And, although my historical knowledge might be imperfect, I wouldn’t doubt that the slaves were paid expenses to travel to Congress in Washington DC to complain to the government about their situation. 
JUL5	The five ways that the Remain alliance could derail Boris Johnson	Adored by hikers, endured by the soldiers who train there and admired the world over, the Brecon Beacons are, it is said, named after ancient beacons lit to warn of impending attacks. These days, this national park is also a Dark Sky Reserve, as famous for its lack of light as for the beacons which once broadcast their fiery warnings over this handsome hunk of Wales.
JUL6	I won't stand by as friends and family in the North are lied to by a Brexiteer stockbroker with no thought for their future	Politics is seeing those you care about supporting lies from those you know will hurt them. Politics is seeing mums and dads whose world revolves around their child’s future, supporting people who, evidence suggests, will make it less bright. Politics is seeing nans and grandads who love their grandchildren more than words can ever describe, choosing to support a political party that will see the small hands they hold having to work harder for longer. 
JUL6	Pride has helped build awareness of trans people, but the workplace can still be a place of utter dread	Thanks to a deluge of media coverage, largely sensationalising or demonising trans people, public awareness of us is at an all-time high. But public understanding of us? Less so.  For many trans people, this lack of enlightenment becomes particularly apparent in the workplace. 
JUL6	‘Well what did we have two world wars for? Fun?’ Leaving the EU is the only issue for Tory leadership voters	We are crying out for a strong person. It is their strength that we are seeking. Boris offers that. We want someone strong. We haven’t had a strong leader since Margaret Thatcher. Boris is the nearest and the best. He is a strong man. He is a heavyweight.” Linda Owen, who is 81, says these words while framed by a proscenium arch of Margaret Thatcher photographs on the wall beside her. She is sitting inside Margaret Thatcher House, as Romford MP Andrew Rosindell has renamed his constituency office in what is technically east London but spiritually very much Essex.
JUL6	Schools have been forced to send children home early – and now poorer kids will suffer the most	Ten years into austerity, schools have found countless ways to get by on squeezed budgets, from banning colour photocopies to making staff redundant. For years it has been a delicate balancing act – what can we get rid of while minimising damage to our pupils? But there comes a point when there is nothing left to give. Over 200 headteachers across the country are now turning to a new way to save money: reducing the length of the school week. Pupils are sent home at lunch time on Friday. In place of a five-day school week, there is a 4.5 one instead. 
JUL6	Airports in the American Revolution? The surprise might be how many people don’t know that’s wrong	President Trump has stated, or if you accept his account, misread, that the continental army “took over the airports” from the British army during the American Revolutionary War. This is not a matter of fake news, or one of the now over 10,000 “false or misleading” claims that the Washington Post newspaper has counted. This is just plain stupid news.
JUL6	Mea Culpa: A moment in history worth waiting for	In an article about how the attitudes of Conservative Party members had hardened on the question of Europe since David Cameron won the 2015 election, we said that, “at that moment in time”, two-thirds of members said they had not decided how they would vote in the referendum. This is verbiage; a needlessly long way of saying, “at that time…”  I checked to see how often we were guilty of this padding, and discovered that the phrase is a favourite of Phil Neville, coach of the England women’s football team. In our report of a virus hitting the team before the Norway game, he used it twice, saying of Millie Bright, “She’s in her room, recovering at this moment in time,” and then, “She is more than likely going to be fit but, at this moment in time, she is a doubt.” (She played in the end, contributing to England’s 3-0 victory.)
JUL6	The Tour de France is a festival of ‘sportwashing’ – and cycling is as guilty as the sponsors	The title sponsor of German professional cycling team, Bora, is Hansgrohe SE – one of the world’s largest suppliers of shower heads and hand showers. As the Tour de France begins today in Brussels, one can see the logic of such a deal: hot, sweaty, dusty days followed by a refreshing post-stage soak in the shower.  That should appeal not only to the competing riders, but also to the millions of fans watching the race either from the side of a French road, or on a mobile device or television somewhere in the world. It’s the kind of alignment between team and sponsor that represents a new face of professional cycling, in which business is helping to consign the sport’s greatly tarnished reputation to the past. 
JUL6	Anti-trans activists are taking the power out of Pride	Pride is supposed to be a celebration of our differences, of the fact that it’s okay to be a gay man, a lesbian woman, bisexual, an intersex person, queer and yes, even trans.  It’s a middle finger to those who would aim to make us unhappy and our lives harder, a defiant staring down of wider society. One where we let everyone know that we’re here and we love who we are with an incredible gleefulness, even despite the dire situations we’re often put in.
JUL6	Hunt is wrong about sanctions. I’ve seen for myself how they hurt the poor yet leave leaders untouched	The seizure of an Iranian oil tanker allegedly bound for Syria by British Royal Marine commandos off Gibraltar is the latest episode in the long and disastrous history of economic sanctions in the Middle East. The UK claims that it is implementing EU sanctions on Syria, but the act will be seen by Tehran – and most other states – as the British enforcing US sanctions on Iran that the EU said it opposes. An Iranian official said a British tanker should be seized in retaliation. Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary and aspirant prime minister, eager to show himself walking tall on the international stage, tweeted: “Swift action has denied valuable resources to Assad’s murderous regime.”
JUL6	I’ve marched at Pride for decades – don’t let anyone tell you we don’t still need it today	They say you never forget your first Pride. I certainly haven’t forgotten mine, when two impossibly beautiful young guys in bondage gear ran up to me to declare that “you have the best hair at Pride!” At 19 (in the days before the advent of useful hair products) I had thick black curls all the way down to my waist that I’d spend hours scrunch-drying. It was wonderful to get some appreciation for my efforts from people who wouldn’t look out of place in a My Little Pony-themed S&M dungeon.
JUL7	Could Labour deselections give Corbyn his own AOC to fight alongside in the next general election?	In the four years since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, “deselection” has come to be seen as a dirty word. For a threatened party aristocracy it conjures up images of a rabble of ideologically pure Trotskyites who will stop at nothing to cleanse the party of Blairites and move the party so far to the left it will become unrecognisable. The worry is overdone. The Labour’s membership may be passionate and left-wing, but in my experience they aren’t extreme. They use public services, often work in the public sector themselves and have seen the devastating effects of austerity on modern Britain.
JUL7	Boris Johnson is heading for a landslide victory – and then disaster	There is only one question in British politics at the moment. Can a no-deal Brexit be stopped? Yes it can, and so Boris Johnson is set to become prime minister on a false prospectus. According to YouGov, 74 per cent of Conservative Party members intend to elect him as leader – on a pledge to leave the EU, deal or no deal, on 31 October. That is a promise he cannot guarantee to deliver. 
JUL7	As a bisexual disabled person of colour, Black Pride celebrates me in ways that mainstream LGBT+ events never have	I’ve been out as bisexual for the past 27 years. My first pride came in 1995. I experienced racism and dismissal from white LGBT+ attendees. I was disappointed, but the novelty of being visibly out and proud took the edge off. A little.  Fast forward a few years to the first and last time I attended Brighton Pride. The same racism was present; this time it came clad in army fatigues styled by white gay men who looked on with disdain as I marched alongside them. Later in the day as I entered Preston Park, one of these men spat on me. I cried all the way back to London.
JUL7	Schools have been forced to send children home early – and now poorer kids will suffer the most	Ten years into austerity, schools have found countless ways to get by on squeezed budgets, from banning colour photocopies to making staff redundant.

In place of a five-day school week, there is a 4.5 one instead. 
JUL7	Matteo Salvini’s relentless attacks on migrants make me sick – where’s his compassion?	Matteo Salvini, how dare you call those who rescue other people from drowning “jackals”? What do you call politicians who milk racism to get power and money?  I know what I call them.
JUL7	Should white members of the LGBT+ community be allowed to attend UK Black Pride?	This weekend, as part of one of the most anticipated celebrations of the summer, thousands of people have made the trek to the capital for Pride. But the parade didn’t end yesterday. Today, UK Black Pride, one of the most significant Pride events in the country, will be held in Hackney’s Haggerston Park for the first time.  UK Black Pride is Europe’s largest party for LGBT+ people of African, Asian, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and Latin American descent, and creates a safe space for people from these diverse backgrounds to celebrate their sexuality, culture and shared experiences. Their mission statement echoes that sentiment, saying: “UK Black Pride promotes unity and cooperation among LGBT+ people of diasporic communities in the UK, as well as their friends and families.”
JUL7	I don’t trust the Tories to lift a finger for our environment – but a Final Say referendum can reset the debate	We have pondered, pontificated, ummed and ahhed about what Brexit will do to our country’s economy, political infrastructure and our social cohesion. The topic has dominated headlines, conversations and the national consciousness for three years. But the truth is that none of this matters if we allow our world to burn.  The planet is on fire, and we are the pyromaniacs holding the flamethrower. It is choking and suffocating on our waste while we refuse to do anything about it.
JUL7	Ann Widdecombe’s comments about Britain being a colony are utterly shameful	I see Ann Widdecombe made a speech in the European parliament yesterday comparing Britons to slaves under their EU masters. She’s right, it’s exactly the same.

JUL8	I'm a United Nations diplomat. This is how bad the Kim Darroch leaked email chain really is	Few things are more carefully choreographed than diplomatic meetings. Whether it’s a special kind of handshake or a deliberately frosty reception to condemn some sort of international meddling or perceived slight, the moves representatives make in front of the world press are intended to have consequences. A state visit, for example — like the one that US President Donald Trump recently embarked upon with the UK — will likely take months of preparations to get right. Being in the room for these preparations is exhilarating: the arguments, the counterarguments, the considerations about how often a smile should be deployed, whether or not a joke will land — everything is up for debate. Behind closed doors, things are very different. Each civil service uses roughly the same protocol for communication within its walls, and externally. Governed by memos, aide memoires, and note verbales, each document has a formal mechanism and meaning. While the content can vastly differ, there is one sacrosanct principle: everything is honestly written and is delivered in a secure and confidential manner. Everyone understands that what is said is not intended to go any further.
JUL8	AOC wants to change the world through action. Nancy Pelosi wants to do it through pithy phrases	In her column “It’s Nancy Pelosi’s Parade,” New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd argues this week that Nancy Pelosi has “offered a master class, with flair and fire, on how a woman can spar with Trump.” But how true is that assertion? An ageing president with increasing displays of cognitive decline is presently shepherding in a far-right future for the United States, complete with concentration camps reportedly housing migrant children in conditions no human being should have to endure. As Trump does all of this with the sort of bellicosity expected of an entitled narcissistic bigot with a lifelong chip on his shoulder and penchant for grifting, there is Nancy Pelosi… not even taking a stand with an impeachment inquiry.
JUL8	Outraged white tears about AfroFuture festival just proved we need spaces where white people aren't invited at all	 Nationwide, people are having conversations about reparations and grappling with an inescapable reality: that white people in this country owe black people a huge debt. Recently, AfroFuture Fest — a Detroit-based music festival — implemented a ticket pricing structure designed to address that debt. They charged white festival-goers twice as much as people of color.  A “POC” ticket cost $20 while a “non-POC” ticket cost $40. After an online outcry, all tickets will now cost $20 and white folks will be prompted to give an addition suggested donation.  
JUL8	As a bisexual disabled person of colour, Black Pride celebrates me in ways that mainstream LGBT+ events never have	I’ve been out as bisexual for the past 27 years. My first pride came in 1995. I experienced racism and dismissal from white LGBT+ attendees. I was disappointed, but the novelty of being visibly out and proud took the edge off. A little.  Fast forward a few years to the first and last time I attended Brighton Pride. The same racism was present; this time it came clad in army fatigues styled by white gay men who looked on with disdain as I marched alongside them. Later in the day as I entered Preston Park, one of these men spat on me. I cried all the way back to London.
JUL8	Matteo Salvini’s relentless attacks on migrants make me sick – where’s his compassion?	Matteo Salvini, how dare you call those who rescue other people from drowning “jackals”? What do you call politicians who milk racism to get power and money?  I know what I call them.
JUL8	Could Labour deselections give Corbyn his own AOC to fight alongside in the next general election?	In the four years since Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, “deselection” has come to be seen as a dirty word. For a threatened party aristocracy it conjures up images of a rabble of ideologically pure Trotskyites who will stop at nothing to cleanse the party of Blairites and move the party so far to the left it will become unrecognisable. The worry is overdone. The Labour’s membership may be passionate and left-wing, but in my experience they aren’t extreme. They use public services, often work in the public sector themselves and have seen the devastating effects of austerity on modern Britain.
JUL8	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shouldn't insult Nancy Pelosi. She should learn from her	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took the oath of office less than six months ago. For some reason, she and her large Twitter following thinks that entitles her to second-guess House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Unfortunately for Ocasio-Cortez, she continually brings a knife to a gun-fight.  Ocasio-Cortez made a splash when she won her primary race. The favorable coverage she received due to her age and unlikely win set things up nicely for her social media empire, where she's amassed nearly 5 million followers on Twitter and 4 million on Instagram. 
JUL8	I challenge my fellow Tory MPs to stop sitting on their hands and finally head off a ruinous no-deal Brexit	A no-deal departure from the EU is a threat to the union of our United Kingdom, our economy and our parliamentary democracy. Today there is another chance for Conservative MPs who understand how damaging no deal really is to at least vote to stop it happening by shutting down parliament. After months filled with robust words, they should now step up to the plate. After all the talk, it’s time to walk the walk.  We won’t need an alternative parliament if MPs use the real one we already have. Who or what is stopping them? It’s simple – back up your words with action. Otherwise, it’s like standing by while a car crash happens and then expecting thanks for arriving with a first aid bag too late. 
JUL8	Greece rejects Syriza while welcoming back Varoufakis – and dealing a blow to far-right populism	 So Greece has reverted to its tradition of having a family dynasty in charge of the country. 
JUL8	Our future prime minister is implicated in alleged electoral fraud. This can’t be ignored	Our attempts to expedite the investigation by the Metropolitan Police (MPS) into alleged electoral offences by the Vote Leave campaign seems to be making waves.  It prompted a letter from the Met Police to the lawyers acting on our behalf suggesting the delay is due to a failure by the Electoral Commission to hand over papers needed to complete their investigation. The Commission has countered by accusing the MPS of “unfounded, misleading and incorrect” allegations.  
JUL9	With prime time TV at his mercy, Boris Johnson was just a smirking Gremlin. He will dissolve on contact with the truth	It started two minutes late, so it is hard to say whether the angry woman standing in the street screaming, “I don’t want you! Nobody wants you!” was officially part of ITV’s Britain’s Next Prime Minister or merely the end of Emmerdale. Either way, it was downhill from there, and very fast indeed.
JUL9	The psychological reasons behind why Trump behaves the way he does — and how the American public can break free	Ambassador Kim’s opinion of the Trump administration — in which leaked emails detailed issues of ineptitude and the disbelief that any improvement was possible — have struck the very core of what makes this current POTUS tick. While much of his posturing and bombast can be chalked up to “putting on a good face” or showmanship for ratings, Trump knows that a quietly specific and unpublicised opinion of his failings is the public equivalent of a parent saying, “I’m just really, really disappointed.” It cuts to the core of the insecure child because it isn’t about anything but their inability to impress. And Trump...oh, he wants to impress. At all costs.  When someone is low, when they have no credibility, no honesty, no elevation of their private self, they seek to lower all others with their creation of a false reality in which they aren’t failing — everyone else is. In fact, the most common survival method of insecure narcissism is to flip undesirable traits in themselves onto those that created those feelings, then attach some other magnanimous and likely untrue quality to themselves. Trump’s response to Sir Kim?
JUL9	I was the first Muslim ever elected to US Congress — and what I see happening in the UK scares me	I’ve seen personally what hate looks like. Back in the 1990s, as a young criminal defense attorney, I represented young men in two different cases who were eventually acquitted after being charged for defending themselves against white supremacists.  Ever since then, I’ve closely followed how the far right’s language and images have leached into society; how it tries to justify its existence while concealing its violence; and how it’s become a globally connected movement.
JUL9	We could do with getting rid of some of Wimbledon’s ‘traditions’ – most of them are impractical anyway	So yesterday was “Manic Monday” at Wimbledon, but it is hard to understand why.  There were some top-class matches, but who’s watching tennis on the first day of the working week? The TV audience must be very low.
JUL9	AOC wants to change the world through action. Nancy Pelosi wants to do it through pithy phrases	In her column “It’s Nancy Pelosi’s Parade,” New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd argues this week that Nancy Pelosi has “offered a master class, with flair and fire, on how a woman can spar with Trump.” But how true is that assertion?

JUL9	Tom Steyer thinks our country's problems can be solved by a white guy with lots of money. There's just one problem	I remember a few months ago watching a Tom Steyer impeachment ad and thinking: this very boring white guy is going to run for president, isn’t he?  But then he kept promising that he wasn’t going to run for president. In January, Steyer went to Iowa and said, “Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president,” but instead “I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.” But it didn’t smell right. After all, why was this man doing the ads himself if he wasn’t trying to build a presidential-feeling brand? People who aren’t running for president don’t generally feature themselves prominently in the ads they pay for. So I wasn’t much surprised this week when Steyer decided that 23 candidates aren’t enough. That what the Democratic primary contest really needs is yet another white guy.
JUL9	Labour's Brexit challenge to the next Tory PM has come at the perfect moment	Labour’s new push for a second referendum is the right call and at the right time.  Jeremy Corbyn has challenged the next prime minister to back putting his deal or no deal to the public with Labour campaigning for Remain in a new referendum. The shift brings to an end what critics have called Labour’s “constructive ambiguity” and fence-sitting over Brexit. Labour is certainly unambiguously opposed to a Tory-fuelled Brexit.
JUL9	David Attenborough tells MPs the hard truth on climate change, but they can’t afford to listen	Sir David Attenborough regularly battles it out with the Queen for the title of the county’s “most trusted person” – a fact he always puts down to a single cause. “I have never done a commercial. Never. Ever,” he said in a newspaper interview in 2006. “If I have any quality on the screen, it’s that people believe that what I say is true. Or at least, they certainly believe that I believe it’s true. Once it’s known that you’ll say anything, you’re as dead as doorknob. You’ve lost everything.”
JUL9	Instagram’s toothless updates won’t stop cyberbullying – tech giants are shirking their social responsibilities	How do you monitor social media when it is so popular, complex and fast-mutating? It’s a serious and complicated question – and the tragic case of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her life, reminded us that we must find the answers. In an effort to respond, and tackle the cyber abuse that affects so many teenagers, the picture-sharing app Instagram has now announced two new features. The first is an anti-bullying tool, which will use artificial intelligence to recognise when new posts are similar to those that have been reported as inappropriate. So far, so good. But once the nefarious or abusive language has been identified, the perpetrator is not served with a reminder of the social and legal ramifications of online abuse. No, they’re merely asked a single, feeble question.
JUL10	Trump is angry about my hometown banning the Pledge of Allegiance. Here's the real story behind the outraged tweets	Apparently, Donald Trump multitasks his outrage. Still ranting at the UK government over leaks from the Trump-critical correspondence of newly resigned UK ambassador Kim Darroch to a British tabloid, he pivoted from this major diplomatic incident to busy his tiny tweeting fingers with the civic matters of my hometown yesterday. His issue? The council of St Louis Park, a leafy inner-ring Minneapolis suburb, announced recently that it would cease a 30-year tradition of pre-gavel recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.  Shortly after the President’s intervention, a flying picket of concerned citizens from other suburbs and angry out-of-towners descended on City Hall in MAGA hats and flag-laden apparel, loudly chanting allegiance on boulevards and sidewalks I recognised immediately.
JUL10	Kim Darroch’s forced resignation as US ambassador is a disgrace – and it proves just how weak Britain is now	The resignation of Sir Kim Darroch proves a few things about the state of the United Kingdom as it edges towards Brexit. Only one is encouraging. First, Sir Kim’s decision to put country before career shows that there is, in some parts of British life, still such a thing as a sense of honour. After Boris Johnson’s failed to back him in the latest ITV debate he must have realised his position was hopeless; Jeremy Hunt’s robust defence of him is of little use if Hunt doesn’t become PM, as he almost certainly will not.
JUL10	Like Sadiq Khan, I’m the son of a Pakistani immigrant – I never expected he’d fail Bame Uber drivers like me	Three years ago, when Sadiq Khan was elected mayor of London, it seemed like things were finally going to change after almost a decade of Tory control of City Hall. As a UK-born son of a Pakistani immigrant, I was hopeful that someone like Khan, who shared my background, would look after my interests. What I now believe, is that this couldn’t have been farther from the truth. 
JUL10	I was the first Muslim ever elected to US Congress — and what I see happening in the UK scares me	I’ve seen personally what hate looks like.

JUL10	Boris Johnson’s refusal to budge on Brexit has backed him into a corner – and a general election will be the only way out	“Optimism is not enough.” That’s the view in Whitehall, articulated by one senior civil servant, of what is seen as Boris Johnson’s very thin plan for Brexit. True, Johnson got a cheer from the studio audience at last night’s head-to-head ITV debate when he neatly hit back at Jeremy Hunt’s claim that he was “peddling optimism”. Johnson replied: “I think we need a bit of optimism.” Previously, he has spoken about using “positive energy” to break the Brexit impasse.
JUL10	Amazon’s move to provide medical advice through Alexa is terrifying for parents like me – it will cloud our natural instincts	In the last month, I’ve found out that a lump on my gum is an infection, and that abnormal liver function results are a pregnancy hangover rather than a symptom of cancer. Rationally, I knew that in context neither of these things were likely to end with me ordering my coffin. But emotionally, as the solo parent to two young children, my greatest fear is that something will happen to me so I can’t be a good mum. My sleepless nights haven’t been solely from night-feeds. So, news that Alexa will be helping to diagnose illnesses fills me with concern. Voice technology is transforming our lives and is uniquely inclusive: my two-year-old daughter and my 92-year-old grandmother could both command a voice assistant with ease. Over the next decade I think it will be woven so comprehensively through our lives that my children will believe I grew up in the “olden days” just imagining life without it. But this move pushes the burden of medical decision making onto patients themselves, and adds an extra responsibility to parents’ lives that we’re not qualified to undertake. 
JUL10	Donald Trump has withdrawn cartoonist Ben Garrison's invitation to the White House, but he can't conceal the rise of antisemitism	There is now little point denying what many of us have suspected for some time: antisemitism is not a minor issue in Western society, the preserve of a fringe who do not matter, but a mainstream attitude. For all our obsession over the Second World War, and our constant invocation of the Nazis, the heroism of liberating the death camps and the sacrifice made by our nations, rather than address the root causes of antisemitism, we merely swept the thing under the carpet. That failure has now returned to haunt us. As the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported this week, Donald Trump's White House invited a cartoonist, Ben Garrison, to a social media summit. The reason this is a controversial invitation is that Garrison has form, having penned images depicting the financier George Soros and members of the Rothchild family as sinister puppeteers.

Trump’s response to Sir Kim?
JUL11	Diplomacy in DC has become a lot more difficult under Trump. These are the strategies different countries are now taking	Britain's newly departing ambassador Kim Darroch might be the most unfortunate Washington ambassador of the week, but he isn't the only one with a tough job on his hands. The art of diplomacy in the age of Trump is a very complicated one. How do you host parties for establishment Washington elites, but simultaneously cater for those newcomers who hold the most power: the Trump elites? How do you woo top officials without upsetting a president who is renowned for his short temper and sensitivity? In the Trump era, it's far more of a challenge than you might think. 
JUL11	Trump’s hissy-fit over Darroch will blow a chill wind across Britain’s embassies in the Middle East	Just for a moment, let’s forget poor old Kim Darroch. Let’s jump a couple of days in front of this news story. Let me tell you how his utter humiliation and sacrifice at the hands of Trump – and with the connivance of the man who will probably be the next British prime minister – will affect the Middle East. Let’s go first to Riyadh where, just off Al Khawabi street, stands the British embassy, wherein labours Simon Collis, our man in Saudi Arabia. He’s previously served in Bahrain, Tunis, Amman, Dubai, Qatar, Damascus and Baghdad. In other words, he’s an old Arab hand. He’s also a Muslim convert and the first British ambassador to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.

JUL11	Airports in the American Revolution? The surprise might be how many people don’t know that’s wrong	President Trump has stated, or if you accept his account, misread, that the continental army “took over the airports” from the British army during the American Revolutionary War. This is not a matter of fake news, or one of the now over 10,000 “false or misleading” claims that the Washington Post newspaper has counted. This is just plain stupid news.
JUL11	Sorry Cressida Dick, but as a black former detective I know just how racist the Met still is	Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of London’s Metropolitan Police, has sensationally stated that the police force is no longer institutionally racist. As a black former police officer, I’d like to say I’m surprised by these comments, which I disagree with entirely, but sadly I’m not. Since her appointment, it has been clear that Dick was never going to be the person to revolutionise the police and bring about real change. 
JUL11	Tommy Robinson is jailed, and in my 26 years in the courts I can't recall a more blatant or serious example of this type of contempt	All of us are subject to the law of the land. That law includes the Contempt of Court Act 1981, which makes clear that nothing about an “active” criminal case can be published, if it “creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced”. This is the general rule and it applies to all stages of a criminal case from the moment a suspect is even arrested. Generally, the law does not prevent reporting events from inside the courtroom, provided that it amounts to a “fair and accurate report of legal proceedings held in public, published contemporaneously and in good faith.”
JUL11	No wonder Labour antisemitism got the ‘Panorama’ treatment – Tory racism is way too much to fit into an hour	Isn’t it wonderful that our governing party has such an endearing imagination? A survey revealed that 54 per cent of Conservative members believe “Islam is a threat to the British way of life”.  This is impressive when you consider most Tory members live in areas like rural Surrey, so maybe the Godalming Rambling Society is upset that its itinerary has been changed, and instead of the proposed autumn hike to Milford followed by a picnic at the Cricketers Arms, there will now be a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
JUL11	I'm not surprised the acceptance of gay sex in the UK is falling for the first time since the AIDS crisis	Last weekend I attended LGBT+ Pride in London, the city I now call home. It was a defiant day filled with glitter, protest placards and plenty of M&S canned cocktails, but what made this year’s Pride even more special was my Dad joining me to watch the parade. This was a moment I’ll never forget and certainly don’t take for granted. But there are things that many of us in the LGBT+ community, including myself at times, have been guilty of taking for granted. As Pride season comes to an end, we’ve been forced to confront the reality that acceptance towards LGBT+ people in the UK is stalling.
JUL12	I spoke to people worried they'll be targeted by ICE raids this weekend. They are terrified of Donald Trump	Starting this Sunday, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will resume immigration raids, targeting approximately 2,000 people who have been ordered deported or have missed a mandated court appearance. The operation will be carried out in 10 major cities across the US and will include “collateral” deportations, or deportations of undocumented migrants who weren’t specially targeted for deportation but were caught up in the raids.   It isn’t the first time these raids have taken place – the Obama administration stepped up family detention and deportation operations starting in 2014 — but announcing the raids is new. 
JUL12	Straight women need to stop claiming they'd ‘go gay’ for Megan Rapinoe if they really want to be LGBT+ allies	As the United States takes home the trophy for the Women’s Football World Cup for the fourth time, social media is buzzing with adulation for sports superstar and everyone’s crush of the hour: co-captain Megan Rapinoe.  It’s impossible to navigate the internet without stumbling across some version of the “I’m straight but…”, or “I would turn gay for…” proclamations that were rife when Ruby Rose joined hit TV show Orange Is The New Black three years ago, or pretty much any time Kristen Stewart does anything.

JUL12	The occupy movement was a political failure – but it changed everything	Occupy Wall Street is widely regarded as one of radical history’s great failures. Launched in September 2011 to great fanfare, the protests that began in New York City quickly spread across the world. Sparked by anger at the financial crisis, the great recession and the influence of money on politics, Occupy appeared to the outside world as an incoherent and sometimes self-indulgent splurge of rage. If you’re sceptical, even some of the movement’s founders tend to see it this way. Micah White, an Adbusters editor who helped initiate Occupy, would later write a book about how protest itself was now broken as a political strategy.
JUL12	Foreign students aren't just cash cows – they're saving British universities from Brexit's destruction	University applications are up significantly. In particular, applications from China which have risen 30 per cent since last year, exceeding those from Northern Ireland for the first time. Higher education is in a period of increasingly financial uncertainty as the Augur Review and Brexit lurk in the background. These latest student figures will delight many institutions which have come to rely more heavily on the higher student fees that international students can bring, especially from China. 
JUL12	Jewish people are being shut out of the debate on their own suffering – it can't continue	Picture this: a new BBC documentary has just exposed a major problem of sexual harassment in one of the main political parties. Women have bravely spoken out about their experiences, detailing the abuse, the trauma and the subsequent alleged cover-up. It is the main story in many newspapers and given rolling coverage on TV. Guests are invited on panel shows and news stations to discuss the issue. Commentators are given countless column inches to debate it. But there is a problem.
JUL12	Stop telling me I’m too old to listen to young people’s music – I’ll rap along to hip-hop if I want to	It is a well-known fact that with age comes the relief of not giving a damn what other people think about you. Gone are the days of losing sleep over social mishaps – oh the joy. That said, I allow myself a gentle cringe when I remember bumping into Billy Bragg at Glastonbury. He was chatting with a man called Jerry who had two front teeth missing, but as Billy had been my hero since I was 16, I was too giddy to register anything else about his friend. I thrust my camera into Jerry’s hand and said: “Can you take a photo of me and Billy please?” To which my then-boyfriend suddenly piped up: “Shap, let me have the camera and I’ll take a photo of all three of you”. I glared at him and refused. “I just want me and Billy,” I said. So now I have a photograph of me beaming next to a distracted-looking Billy Bragg, taken by Jerry Dammers of The Specials.
JUL12	The buck for Labour’s antisemitism crisis stops with Corbyn – he has to go	The Labour party’s reaction to last night’s BBC Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic? – in which I participated – is a scandal in itself. The party machine has allowed the reputations of ex-staff to be trashed, questioned the integrity of hurt and bewildered young Jews and emboldened its already cultish form of denialism. At best, the present leadership is incapable of understanding Labour’s antisemitism. At worst, it is an enabler of it. The leadership’s time has run out: they have to be replaced.
JUL12	Sorry Cressida Dick, but as a black former detective I know just how racist the Met still is	Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of London’s Metropolitan Police, has sensationally stated that the police force is no longer institutionally racist.

JUL13	I’ve been bullied working at Westminster. This report doesn’t cut it	Thursday saw the publication of the latest of three separate QC-led inquiries into Westminster’s bullying and harassment problem. The details included in Gemma White’s report – of unwanted sexual advances and mental breakdowns precipitated by relentless criticism and unreasonable demands – still have the capacity to shock even those of us who are well acquainted with the awful behaviour of a minority of MPs. I saw this behaviour firsthand as a clerk in the House of Commons. The committee member who piled endless work with impossible deadlines on his dedicated staff team until some became physically ill with stress. The cabinet minister who bawled out his civil service team in front of a large audience after a paper required for a legislation committee had gone missing. The backbencher who cornered me in a quiet corridor and shouted at me for having given advice with which he disagreed. All safe in the knowledge there would be no repercussions.
JUL13	Corporate Britain is treating gender diversity like a tick-box exercise. It has to stop	After all these years – like the most annoying, amnesiac gadfly – I’m still going on about it because the message clearly isn’t resonating: diverse companies make better companies, so gender issues are everyone’s business.  
JUL13	I spoke to people worried they'll be targeted by ICE raids this weekend. They are terrified of Donald Trump	Starting this Sunday, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will resume immigration raids, targeting approximately 2,000 people who have been ordered deported or have missed a mandated court appearance. The operation will be carried out in 10 major cities across the US and will include “collateral” deportations, or deportations of undocumented migrants who weren’t specially targeted for deportation but were caught up in the raids.   It isn’t the first time these raids have taken place – the Obama administration stepped up family detention and deportation operations starting in 2014 — but announcing the raids is new. 
JUL13	Diplomacy in DC has become a lot more difficult under Trump. These are the strategies different countries are now taking	Britain's newly departing ambassador Kim Darroch might be the most unfortunate Washington ambassador of the week, but he isn't the only one with a tough job on his hands. The art of diplomacy in the age of Trump is a very complicated one. How do you host parties for establishment Washington elites, but simultaneously cater for those newcomers who hold the most power: the Trump elites? How do you woo top officials without upsetting a president who is renowned for his short temper and sensitivity? In the Trump era, it's far more of a challenge than you might think.

JUL13	We could do with getting rid of some of Wimbledon’s ‘traditions’ – most of them are impractical anyway	So yesterday was “Manic Monday” at Wimbledon, but it is hard to understand why.  There were some top-class matches, but who’s watching tennis on the first day of the working week? The TV audience must be very low.
JUL13	Disabled children are not scary so please stop using able-bodied actors to portray them in horror films	I went to see Midsommar, Ari Aster’s latest horror flick, on the back of a glowing review by Mark Kermode, whose podcast with Simon Mayo I often listen to while out wheeling. A break-up movie set against the backdrop of a scary cult festival during the summer solstice in the north of Sweden? It sounded weird, inventive and interesting enough to make the effort to endure two and a half hours of psychologically troubling material.
JUL13	Boris Johnson’s vow for a ‘no-deal Brexit’ is a complete fallacy – we would need deals galore just to keep afloat	No-deal Brexit could be Boris Johnson’s biggest deception yet – worse than the Boris bus or the lies that had him sacked as a Times journalist or as a spokesman by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard. Johnson is managing to persuade large parts of the Tory party, the right-wing media and even some voters that no-deal Brexit actually means “no deal”. Not a single one. And that we can stick two fingers up to Europe and float off into the Atlantic towards a Trumpian nirvana. 
JUL13	Straight women need to stop claiming they'd ‘go gay’ for Megan Rapinoe if they really want to be LGBT+ allies	As the United States takes home the trophy for the Women’s Football World Cup for the fourth time, social media is buzzing with adulation for sports superstar and everyone’s crush of the hour: co-captain Megan Rapinoe.  It’s impossible to navigate the internet without stumbling across some version of the “I’m straight but…”, or “I would turn gay for…” proclamations that were rife when Ruby Rose joined hit TV show Orange Is The New Black three years ago, or pretty much any time Kristen Stewart does anything. 
JUL13	Jewish people are being shut out of the debate on their own suffering – it can't continue	Picture this: a new BBC documentary has just exposed a major problem of sexual harassment in one of the main political parties. Women have bravely spoken out about their experiences, detailing the abuse, the trauma and the subsequent alleged cover-up. It is the main story in many newspapers and given rolling coverage on TV. Guests are invited on panel shows and news stations to discuss the issue. Commentators are given countless column inches to debate it. But there is a problem.
JUL14	How do we fix the fallout from the never-ending Kim Darroch affair? Put him in the House of Lords	In her last moments in office, Theresa May has an easy solution to the Sir Kim Darroch affair. Put him in the House of Lords and leave the question of his successor to her successor. A personal confession here. I worked with Darroch in my eight years in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) under Tony Blair and afterwards as Blair’s political envoy to Europe. He was head of the news department, which may sound just like a high-end press officer, but is actually one of the most senior FCO appointments.
JUL14	There’s an art to being a ‘respectable’ spectator at Wimbledon – but few, including me, have mastered it	“Da Simona, Da Simona, Da Simona” is how I’d sum up my experience at Centre Court yesterday, watching the women’s singles final. The cries came from Romanian fans all around the echoey arena, but one supporter in particular captured the hearts, and darting glances, of my block – and not because we loved her, but because we wanted her to shut up. Admittedly, I’m a Serena Williams fan through and through, and watching her play live has been on my bucket list for years. So, the result yesterday wasn’t exactly what I wanted. Being a truly fair spectator though, I cheered when Simona Halep scored some of those points – and let’s be honest, she really did play “out of her mind” as Williams called it in her runner-up speech – and I applauded when she, deservedly, picked up her first Wimbledon trophy.

JUL14	The Top 10: Politician Painters	Sean O’Grady suggested this one, after Boris Johnson’s interview in which he said his hobby was painting: “I get old wooden crates, and then I paint them and – suppose it’s a box that has been used to contain two wine bottles and it will have a dividing thing – I turn it into a bus.” 1. Joseph Beuys, co-founder of the German Green party in 1980. Performance artist, sculptor, painter. Nominated by No Ordinary Cat. 
JUL14	Foreign students aren't just cash cows – they're saving British universities from Brexit's destruction	University applications are up significantly. In particular, applications from China which have risen 30 per cent since last year, exceeding those from Northern Ireland for the first time. Higher education is in a period of increasingly financial uncertainty as the Augur Review and Brexit lurk in the background. These latest student figures will delight many institutions which have come to rely more heavily on the higher student fees that international students can bring, especially from China. 
JUL14	I’ve been bullied working at Westminster. This report doesn’t cut it	Thursday saw the publication of the latest of three separate QC-led inquiries into Westminster’s bullying and harassment problem. The details included in Gemma White’s report – of unwanted sexual advances and mental breakdowns precipitated by relentless criticism and unreasonable demands – still have the capacity to shock even those of us who are well acquainted with the awful behaviour of a minority of MPs. I saw this behaviour firsthand as a clerk in the House of Commons. The committee member who piled endless work with impossible deadlines on his dedicated staff team until some became physically ill with stress. The cabinet minister who bawled out his civil service team in front of a large audience after a paper required for a legislation committee had gone missing. The backbencher who cornered me in a quiet corridor and shouted at me for having given advice with which he disagreed. All safe in the knowledge there would be no repercussions.

JUL15	The question now isn't whether Trump is racist. It's which members of the Republican Party will stand up and prove that they aren't	If you are a person of color or immigrant in America, you've likely heard this before: "Go back to where you came from!" I know I have. As the black son of two immigrants from Sierra Leone, with the name Ahmed Baba, I've been told to go “back to the Middle East” and have been accused of “hating America” when I dare criticize President Trump. The fact I was born in America doesn’t matter, because many among Trump's base appear to hold the false, bigoted belief that being truly American means being white, and that if you’re anti-Trump then you’re anti-America. Apparently, the current President of the United States shares this belief. On Sunday, President Trump took to Twitter and told four freshmen congresswomen of color to “go back” to where they came from. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-IL) are all citizens and were born in America — with the exception of Omar, who was born in Somalia but moved to the US and was naturalized as a child. Today, Trump doubled down on those sentiments in a press conference by demanding those freshman congresswomen apologize. He then accused them of being racist, said they hate America, and reiterated that if they're "not happy" in the US, they can leave.
JUL15	The US is quietly waging war in Somalia – and Trump has made it worse	Only two civilians have been killed or injured in the entirety of the US’s bombing campaign of Somalia — that is, according to the US Africa Command (AFRICOM). But is that true? I doubt it. The campaign has gone on now for more than a decade, and new internal documents, obtained and released last week by The Intercept, give credible evidence that the US “has long been aware of multiple attacks that left civilians dead or wounded following operations by US or allied forces.”  Questions about how many civilians die in America’s drone wars have long been subject to controversy, but there is an even bigger question at hand here: What exactly is the US’s campaign in Somalia supposed to accomplish?
JUL15	England's cricket win shows why we need more diverse sports teams	Five years ago I left my senior position in investment banking. With my newly discovered free time, I entered social entrepreneurship and joined the Lawn Tennis Association, the national governing body of tennis, pursuing my passion of getting more kids from diverse backgrounds into sports. I was shocked at how white and middle class some of our sports – especially tennis and other  racket sports – were, and I wanted to change it. Yesterday’s historic win by a very multicultural England cricket team has reminded me why I made that choice – 43 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women playing international cricket for England went to private school, and it was inspiring to see the sport opening up to a diverse team, and an equally diverse audience. 
JUL15	The government telling people like me to get more sleep is shockingly hypocritical	Night care can be knackering. I have experienced this as a carer for 31 years, for various family members, at times involving overnight support before heading off to my job in the morning. Even with a couple of nights’ respite weekly, this was tough. But I now realise how lucky I was. Years of harsh cuts have resulted in a social care crisis which leaves numerous carers exhausted. Yet more proposed tax cuts for the rich and big business are likely to leave even more families without desperately-needed support.
JUL15	Why we should tax air travel more – and shout about it	I am a tree-hugger and worry about climate change at least as much as the next standard-issue, liberal member of the chattering classes. Yet it wasn’t until a friend mentioned she would probably never travel to far-flung places again that I seriously considered doing the same and generally flying less. It wasn’t that I didn’t know that planes are some of the biggest polluters on the planet. It’s just that I’d been flying regularly for so long that I was doing it on autopilot (pun unintended), without questioning the way we always buy the same brand of toothpaste or take the same route to work even if it may not be the quickest one.
JUL15	We could do with getting rid of some of Wimbledon’s ‘traditions’ – most of them are impractical anyway	So yesterday was “Manic Monday” at Wimbledon, but it is hard to understand why.  There were some top-class matches, but who’s watching tennis on the first day of the working week? The TV audience must be very low.
JUL15	Boris Johnson once had a loose handle on his chaotic affairs – but doing it as prime minister will be impossible	The more I ponder the coming of Boris Johnson, the more I worry about the effect his private life will have on his public duties. He likes to keep the two separate, but, in the modern media age, and with all the pressures of Brexit they cannot be hermetically sealed one from the other.  We saw the furore over the row he had with Carrie Symonds. Now some ancient controversies, such as the so-called Guppygate affair are being dredged up. Admittedly a taped phone conversation in which Johnson apparently agrees to assist an old friend from Eton, Darius Guppy, in an attack on a journalist is a serious matter, even if, as Johnson maintains, nothing “eventuated” form the call.
JUL15	The president of the United States is a racist troll – Trump is no better than those who object to me as a British MP	From as early as I can remember, I was used to meeting people and their first two questions being: “What is your name?” and “Where do you come from?” – and not always in that order. My answer was always “Tooting” and still is today. The questions did not, and do not, stop there: “Where do you REALLY come from?” – with a huge emphasis on the “really”.  My mother was born in Poland, my father in Pakistan, and I identify as being 100 per cent Tooting. Generally, people understand this and I am so fortunate to represent an area which is so vibrant and diverse. There are people from all backgrounds, first generation, second generation and beyond, who each day have to go through the same line of questioning over and over. 
JUL15	Trans people aren’t ‘erasing’ lesbians like me – I’ll fight for equality standing side-by-side with them	It’s not easy to move through the world as a butch lesbian. It never has been. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been subject to the most vile abuse for challenging what it means to be a woman – misogyny is a right pain in the tits.  But never fear, because over the weekend there were two newspaper stories leaping to the defence of lesbians like me. An article in The Times suggested that lesbians like me are “besieged by society and sidelined within the LGBT+ community”. Scotland on Sunday also ran a cover story which identified supposed “splits” in the LGBT+ movement over “gender issues”.
JUL15	Labour's new position on Brexit misses the mark – it's time to go all guns blazing for Remain	Britain needs a Labour government. With the NHS in crisis, the economy slipping into recession and the adverse impacts of austerity blighting lives and communities, we urgently need a change of direction. The Tories meanwhile are drifting further into the realms of fantasy economics and diplomacy. Their increasingly shrill demands for a no-deal Brexit, encouraged by Boris Johnson’s aping of Farage, clash with a parliament that is adamant it will not allow no deal to happen. As a result, a general election seems increasingly likely.
JUL16	Trump's new plan for asylum seekers isn't just stupid and xenophobic — it's unworkable	A new law is set to be published in the Federal Register today that practically eliminates applications from asylum seekers at the southern US border, requiring them to apply for refugee status in another country first.  In yesterday’s announcement, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice stipulated that, unless an applicant for asylum can prove that they already applied for protective status in a third country before arriving in US territory, they will be ineligible.
JUL16	Miley Cyrus is right – there is no such thing as virginity	Miley Cyrus has come a long way from the sanitised Disney Channel persona of her early years. We’re accustomed to a new Miley now – an artist who challenges conventions, who isn’t afraid to be obscene or political. Her latest video for the song “Mother’s Daughter” is exactly what I’d expect from her. It’s racy and empowering, featuring Cyrus and a diverse cast of activists, creators, and celebrities. Each one has a marginalised identity not typically seen within pop culture. The video is also littered with feminist slogans, including one that has sparked controversy online: virginity is a social construct.
JUL16	The US is quietly waging war in Somalia – and Trump has made it worse	Only two civilians have been killed or injured in the entirety of the US’s bombing campaign of Somalia — that is, according to the US Africa Command (AFRICOM). But is that true? I doubt it. The campaign has gone on now for more than a decade, and new internal documents, obtained and released last week by The Intercept, give credible evidence that the US “has long been aware of multiple attacks that left civilians dead or wounded following operations by US or allied forces.”  Questions about how many civilians die in America’s drone wars have long been subject to controversy, but there is an even bigger question at hand here: What exactly is the US’s campaign in Somalia supposed to accomplish?
JUL16	I love new technology, but we need governments to start regulating it properly – for all our sakes	The mind boggles at the technology we are now using, which a few years ago we would very much have associated with science fiction and not reality. It is now part of everyday life and developing at such a speed that legislators and governments are struggling to keep up.  We have just started using a Google Home device in the Umunna household. It’s a smart speaker similar to Amazon Alexa that answers your questions, gets the news, plays songs, and enables you to control other apps, (like Spotify), hands free, using your own voice. We weren’t really following yesterday’s Wimbledon men’s final so during the match I asked Google Home and it told me what the current score was.
JUL16	Why we should tax air travel more – and shout about it	I am a tree-hugger and worry about climate change at least as much as the next standard-issue, liberal member of the chattering classes. Yet it wasn’t until a friend mentioned she would probably never travel to far-flung places again that I seriously considered doing the same and generally flying less. It wasn’t that I didn’t know that planes are some of the biggest polluters on the planet. It’s just that I’d been flying regularly for so long that I was doing it on autopilot (pun unintended), without questioning the way we always buy the same brand of toothpaste or take the same route to work even if it may not be the quickest one.
JUL16	The push for gender-neutral uniforms is great – but it has nothing to do with being trans	Joy! The phone rings, tearing me from happy slumber and putting an abrupt end to dreamtime. It’s a private number. So I know, even before I answer, that this will either be some earnest call-centre type concerned by the accident in which I was recently injured, or a media outlet seeking comment on the latest transgender-agenda-gone-mad story. I am not disappointed. Schools in Wales have adopted gender-neutral uniforms. Would I, a trans person, like to comment on how this would have made my school days easier?
JUL16	A racist tweet from a racist president – so why couldn't people call it out for what it was?	Let’s take a look at one of the headlines that greeted Donald Trump’s latest dive into the sewer this week: “Republicans stay quiet over Trumps ‘racist’ tweets.” Can you see what’s wrong with the BBC’s take? The word racist is in quotes. ITV did the same thing with its online reporting of the US president’s Twitter tirade. Sky did its best to avoid using the term at all, preferring to talk about a “race row”. 
JUL16	Now we know that women enjoy porn as much as men, can we have a proper conversation about it?	Women are just as likely to be aroused by porn as men. It may not sound terribly surprising, but this latest scientific research presents a huge opportunity for those of us who have been waiting for a change in the way we talk about and educate people on pornography.  
JUL16	New statistics confirm what we already knew – Islamophobia is thriving in all parts of British society	It has been eight years since Baroness Warsi declared that Islamophobia had “passed the dinner table test” in Britain. Sadly, anti-Muslim prejudice remains a huge problem in the UK. Despite steady, incremental liberal shifts in public attitudes, Warsi’s comments – that Islamophobia was not limited to “those who display their bigotry overtly, but also those who do so more subtly in the most respectable of settings: middle-class dinner tables” – are just as relevant today.
JUL16	This is the speech the potential EU chief should have given if she really wanted the Green vote	This morning, Ursula von der Leyen, EU Commission president nominee, made a speech to the Strasbourg parliament to try to convince at least 374 MEPs to vote her into the Brussels top job. A narrow victory, in which she depends on right-wing support, would give her a fragile mandate to steer the EU for the next five years. As a woman and a European, I couldn’t help being moved listening to EU Commission presidential hopeful von der Leyen’s speech. Her commitment to the peace project and the possibility of the first woman president of the Commission were always going to be reasons to welcome her.
JUL17	I used to work in US intelligence advising presidents on risk. The biggest threat to our country today is the Republican Party	I used to help draft the National Intelligence Estimate.  In case you’re not familiar with the finer points of threat assessment within the national security apparatus, the NIE is the big enchilada: the document seen by presidents and members of congress; an objective, non-political, comprehensive piece of work that categorises and prioritises the threats faced by the United States. 
JUL17	I thought I’d seen everything as a White House reporter. Then Kellyanne Conway asked my ethnicity	After a decade as a journalist in Washington DC, working for a variety of outlets and covering a number of different beats, I’d thought I’d seen everything. Apparently, I was wrong. No elected representative or government official enjoys being on the receiving end of pointed – even adversarial – questions, but because most understand that it’s part and parcel of life in a country with a free press, I never expected one of my questions to elicit a response like the one got from Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway. This week, I asked her what countries President Trump was referring to in a tweet storm 48 hours earlier, when he’d suggested that a quartet of freshman House Democrats — women and minorities all – could “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”
JUL17	Trump's new plan for asylum seekers isn't just stupid and xenophobic — it's unworkable	A new law is set to be published in the Federal Register today that practically eliminates applications from asylum seekers at the southern US border, requiring them to apply for refugee status in another country first.  In yesterday’s announcement, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice stipulated that, unless an applicant for asylum can prove that they already applied for protective status in a third country before arriving in US territory, they will be ineligible.

Yet more proposed tax cuts for the rich and big business are likely to leave even more families without desperately-needed support.
JUL17	Someone needs to sit Joe Biden down and explain you cannot bro your way to the presidency	In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe – which faithful viewers know is a de facto cheerleading squad for Joe Biden and his presidential campaign – the former vice president revealed this week that if President Trump mocks his age or questions his mental state in a presidential debate, he has his response ready. And before I reveal the response, let it be apparent to all reading that some of y’all’s “Uncle Joe” really thought he nailed his reply. Bless his heart. “I’d say, ‘C’mon Donald, c’mon man. How many push-ups do you want to do here, pal?’” Biden answered. “I mean, jokingly. . . . C’mon, run with me, man.”
JUL17	The biggest player in the Tory leadership contest isn’t Boris Johnson – it’s Donald Trump	When the six-week Conservative leadership election began, it looked as if Nigel Farage would be the spectre hanging over it, as the candidates tried to reassure Tory members they would see off the threat from his Brexit Party. As the contest draws to a close, there is a new menace: Donald Trump.  Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt won headlines after criticising the US president for suggesting that four congresswomen of colour should “go back” to the nations “from which they came”. But it was hardly the Love Actually moment the headlines implied. Johnson and Hunt (as well as Theresa May, at least so far) stopped short of calling Trump out for racism, as the House of Representatives has now done.
JUL17	No, you go home Donald, and take your anchor babies with you	Never mind the “squad” – the four congresswomen of colour racially abused by their own president – it’s Donald Trump who ought to “go back” whence he came – because he doesn’t understand or particularly like America. Destination? Either Bavaria or Scotland, depending on whether his emigration is to be via the patrilineal or matrilineal line. After all, he has spent most of his adult life moaning about why America isn’t good enough for him, how the Democrats (when he wasn’t on first name terms with the Clintons) were ruining everything and, even now, they are getting in the way of “making  America great again”, as the slogan goes. 
JUL17	Brexit's Doctor Doom came to the House of Commons with a simple message: we're all doomed	Telling politicians that Brexit is a terrible idea that will go very badly is what put Sir Ivan Rogers out of a job, so it’s pleasing to see he’s still picking up a few freelance gigs. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee is one you do more for the “exposure” than the cash, but Sir Ivan wasn’t wasting any time boosting his profile.
JUL18	Trump has found himself in a mess with Iran. But one Republican senator could save us all	A new development may have emerged in the stand-off between Washington DC and Tehran this week. Republican Senator Rand Paul is said to have asked Donald Trump’s blessing to reach out to Iran on the president’s behalf. Senator Paul proposed to have a meeting with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, and President Trump signed off on the idea, Politico has reported. The libertarian senator, who has long been a vocal critic of wars in the Middle East and a supporter of diplomacy with Iran, is probably the best chance President Trump has at starting talks with Iran — and avoiding war. Now is the time to do that. 
JUL18	At Cologne’s Gestapo museum, visitors are drawing modern parallels – can we really say they’re being simplistic?	The words would melt a heart of stone – save for those of the Gestapo torturers upstairs. The prisoners wrote their stories, their poems, their last pre-execution laments on the walls of their cells – which you can still read in the basement of the old Nazi secret police headquarters in Cologne. I spent hours there this week, reading the names and messages. Cut into one cell wall are written these lines, in Russian, by a young woman condemned to death, apparently a slave labourer in Cologne who had joined a resistance movement in 1944: 
JUL18	Don't believe the hype around single-use plastic bans – they can do more harm than good	Isola di Capri in Italy boldly announced earlier this year that it was banning the use of single-use plastic ­bags and other selected items, ­singling out – somewhat oddly – tourists, with the threat of fines of up to €500 (£450). While such an initiative certainly grabbed the headlines, the realities of such a scheme seem far less clear-cut in terms of both management and eventual efficacy.
JUL18	Theresa May’s farewell speech: What she said – and what she really meant	What Theresa May said: This will most likely be the last time I will speak at length as prime minister and I would like today to share some personal reflections on the state of politics in our country and around the world. What she really meant: You will be sorry when I’m gone.

JUL18	Christine Lagarde was the first woman to lead the IMF, but that doesn't mean she should be admired	Listen to the hugely expensive public relations speak that is such a big part of global finance nowadays and you will regularly hear Christine Lagarde described as a “rock star”. She has now resigned as the first woman head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after being nominated to become the pioneering female boss of the European Central Bank.  The “first female” tag has also been used time and time again during the 63-year-old’s career. I originally met her at the British Embassy in Paris soon after she became France’s first woman finance minister in 2007. She did not mention her partner, the businessman Xavier Giocanti, nor Thomas Lagarde, the father of her two sons, making it clear she was entirely self-made.
JUL18	Theresa May's tawdry legacy is thousands of children going hungry during the summer holidays	Theresa May’s premiership will come to an end next week, just as the school holidays are beginning. Those who benefit from free school meals will in many cases be relying on the kindness of strangers to ensure that their children do not go hungry when they are not at school.  During the summer break, families who are entitled to free school meals have the additional burden of having to feed them at lunchtime and also pay for prohibitively expensive child care costs if they are in work.
JUL18	If you thought Netflix was invincible think again – latest figures should be a cause for concern	There’s a now famous scene in Captain Marvel where our hero crashes through the roof of a Blockbuster video store.  I’ll bet every parent delighted in explaining the significance of that to their kids on the way out. I know I did. I bet most of them got similar looks to the one I got too.  
JUL18	Someone needs to sit Joe Biden down and explain you cannot bro your way to the presidency	In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe – which faithful viewers know is a de facto cheerleading squad for Joe Biden and his presidential campaign – the former vice president revealed this week that if President Trump mocks his age or questions his mental state in a presidential debate, he has his response ready. And before I reveal the response, let it be apparent to all reading that some of y’all’s “Uncle Joe” really thought he nailed his reply. Bless his heart. “I’d say, ‘C’mon Donald, c’mon man. How many push-ups do you want to do here, pal?’” Biden answered. “I mean, jokingly. . . . C’mon, run with me, man.”
JUL18	While the US debate heats up, why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?	As the world struggles to make its mind up about what is and isn’t racist, another conversation about race and heritage is picking up again – the debate over the payment of reparations. Though the push to pay a price for the damage of history never stopped, it has been ignored and dismissed so effectively that at times the call for justice could barely be heard. Now the reluctant colonial stars – the US, the UK and several major European nations including France and Switzerland – have been dragged back into a discussion about whether any nation can be found responsible, today, for the slave trade and its repercussions. And if they can, whether they should be expected to provide financial compensation.
JUL19	Russia's biggest weapon is Brexit. So where are the Tory MPs willing to save us from it?	Britain is a leading member of Nato. It is something Tory MPs never forget and avidly support. Nato is a multi-national organisation where each country gives up part of its sovereignty to provide security for all. It was created in 1949 with a single purpose – to prevent Russia, then in the form of the Soviet Union, from dividing and destroying Western Europe, which had just overcome a different totalitarian evil at the cost of millions of lives. That purpose remains unchanged. The KGB-led Kremlin has murdered a British citizen in Salisbury, invaded the Ukraine, propped up the murderous Assad regime in Syria and interfered in our democratic processes. Its fighter planes buzz our aircraft and test our defences regularly. Its leader boasts of the triumph of nationalism and authoritarianism over the liberal democracies that so many of our parents’ and grandparents’ generations sacrificed themselves to defend.
JUL19	If a city as green as Bristol will struggle to meet emissions targets, how can the the rest of the country?	At last, Britain’s cities appear to have their first climate repair manual. And although the ink is barely dry, we already need a few more chapters.  While five cities – London, Leeds, Glasgow, Cardiff and Bristol – have witnessed another week of gridlock from thousands of Extinction Rebellion climate protestors, a first pioneering plan has been unveiled by one mayor who is charged with attempting to steer 13 others away from climate disaster. 
JUL19	We need to talk about the worrying consequences of apps that predict ageing	The internet is awash with people sharing photos of themselves looking much older, and wrinklier, than they are, thanks to the FaceApp which essentially presents an image of what you might look like in the future, once the ravages of age have taken hold. The app has already been catapulted into controversy because of concerns about the privacy around the photo access.
JUL19	We tried to stop the murderous airstrike on a Libyan detention centre – but now Britain must act	I want to share with you the words of a Libyan doctor for Médecins Sans Frontières following the fatal airstrike on Tajoura detention centre late at night on 2 July. It is a night that will forever remain etched in this doctor’s memory – and the memories of all MSF staff in Libya – as a horrific nightmare. An estimated 60 people were killed and 70 injured:
JUL19	The Top 10: Songs with a year in the title	Thanks to Neil O’Brien, Conservative MP for Harborough, for this one. He said there are lots of them, and he was right. We stopped counting after collecting 126 nominations, and compiled a Spotify playlist of 84 of them (below). Here are the 10 I like best, in year order.  1. “Louisiana 1927”, Randy Newman. Nominated by Graham Fildes.
JUL19	Don't believe the hype around single-use plastic bans – they can do more harm than good	Isola di Capri in Italy boldly announced earlier this year that it was banning the use of single-use plastic ­bags and other selected items, ­singling out – somewhat oddly – tourists, with the threat of fines of up to €500 (£450). While such an initiative certainly grabbed the headlines, the realities of such a scheme seem far less clear-cut in terms of both management and eventual efficacy.
JUL19	Here's the real problem with Bella Thorne and Tana Mongeau's 'girl code' Twitter fight	You may have thought that when one is in a polyamorous, bisexual relationship which began on Twitter and has since been followed by millions on Instagram Stories and YouTube vlogs, all conventions would fly out of the window. But it seems that even among the most unorthodox of relationships, pointless traditional norms persist. In a tweet yesterday, actor, writer and influencer Bella Thorne told her followers that she was “no longer good” with her ex-girlfriend, YouTuber Tana Mongeau, after she “broke girl code”. This is presumably a reference to Mongeau being photographed leaving a restaurant with rapper Mod Sun – who was also in a relationship with Thorne until earlier this year.
JUL19	Like Ilhan Omar, I'm an elected politician who has been told to 'go home' – it's more than just words	Political language is not pretty at the moment, and it’s only going to get more brutal in the coming weeks and months. Donald Trump is not alone in spotting the link between divisive rhetoric and approval ratings among his base as he switches to full 2020 campaign mode.
JUL19	Male circumcision needs to be seen as barbaric and unnecessary – just like female genital mutilation	The debate over male ritual circumcision – the surgical removal of the foreskin from the penis of a baby boy for religious and cultural reasons – is becoming more prominent each year. A BBC documentary broadcast this week provides further evidence that the tide is beginning to turn on the historic carte blanche afforded to infant circumcision. The non-therapeutic alteration of children’s genitals is typically discussed in two separate ethical discourses: one for girls, in which such alteration is referred to as “female genital mutilation” (or FGM), and one for boys, in which it is usually referred to as “male circumcision”. The former is illegal in the UK and typically regarded as barbaric; the latter, benign or even “beneficial”.
JUL19	Just like the Republicans and their racist president, no Tories will save us from the kipper-waver in chief	Of course Donald Trump isn’t racist just because he told four women to “go back home” to their “crime-infested country”. To start with, they are from a crime-infested country, because they’re all American so you can’t fault him there.
JUL20	Britain is being punished for doing Trump's dirty work in the Gulf – something it can expect more of under Boris Johnson	Iran has won a point over the UK.  Seizing a British oil tanker in the gulf has been always a red line. The Iranians have pushed the UK’s back against the wall, as they said they would do. Their message was loud and clear. But British ministers and diplomats underestimated the Iranian threat. 
JUL20	After battling anorexia, I know it's a mental illness. That's why I find the new research so worrying	A new study in the journal Nature Genetics has suggested that anorexia originates in the body, as well as the mind. I was actually relieved when I first read the news. Having lived with the disorder myself for over four years, any research, in my eyes, is good research. Necessary too. After all, eating disorders are an issue that continue to affect roughly 1.25 million people across the UK, according to UK charity Beat.

JUL20	It is no longer acceptable to question climate change. So why is it now mainstream to criticise Extinction Rebellion?	Extinction Rebellion, the ecological protest group founded in 2018, has initiated its “Summer Uprising”. Namely, blockading roads in cities around the country in order to highlight our reliance on fossil fuels. In response, Policy Exchange, a think tank set up by three Conservative MPs in 2002, has released a paper labelling the group as “extremist” and seeking “to break down the established civil order and liberal democracy in the UK”. 
JUL20	Netanyahu is now Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. His career could end in tragedy	Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu is now Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, breaking the record of Israel’s first leader, the legendary David Ben Gurion.   Netanyahu launched his career mastering television soundbites, explaining Israel to US audiences. Thirty years later, he is still far ahead of the game, firing out Facebook videos. But Netanyahu’s narrative is now a bizarre contradiction. When he talks about Israeli tech and innovation, he exudes hope and optimism about its power to build bridges across the world. By contrast, his analysis of security threats is full of fear and pessimism. His lesson from Jewish history is its inherent fragility and the constant need to avert the next disaster.
JUL20	Half a century ago, the moon landing showed us the fragility of our planet, and that nothing was impossible	Fifty years ago, the Apollo 11 space mission took its place in global history. I remember watching the Apollo 11 moon landing. It was an amazing achievement, enabled by a brilliant team of engineers, scientists and technicians at Nasa. I was still at school and we were utterly awed by the engineering and ingenuity that made it happen. The posters on my wall at university were the famous shot of Neil Armstrong on the moon and the Blue Planet from space.

JUL21	Boris Johnson barely understands what ‘middle income earners’ are – how can he possibly close the UK’s opportunity gap?	What Boris Johnson wants to do as prime minister, he recently said, “is to level up opportunity around the country… closing the opportunity gap”. If Johnson wants to be seen to be taking the concerns of his core supporters seriously, “levelling up opportunity” is something he urgently needs to do. One of the main characteristics of Leave voters is that they are much more likely than their Remain-backing counterparts to say that opportunities to “get on in life” have receded: they are people who “face an increasing challenge in maintaining their life-style” and feel their place in the world to be “declining and/or to be stagnant”).
JUL21	Why teachers should show Love Island in schools	Stay with me on this one. At face value, showing young, impressionable students a bunch of fame-hungry, rather image-obsessed Gen Z’ers hooking up and breaking up with each other in swift fashion may not seem like the best idea.  However, the discussions Love Island provokes are essential given the current climate of #MeToo and #TimesUp. We need to discuss what behaviour is acceptable and what behaviour is not. And it’s teenagers who desperately need these open conversations. 
JUL21	Summer holidays are the worst time of year for Britain’s poorest children – as a GP, I’m incredibly worried	Next week heralds the start of the enviably long summer holiday for millions of children across the UK. For many, this marks the start of six weeks of fun, cultural enrichment and family holidays, but for around 3 million children, the summer holidays are a period of stress, food insecurity, hunger and malnourishment. Many school-age children don’t just rely on school for education or social interaction, but more so – and essentially – for a square meal. Many of my GP colleagues in deprived areas of the country are going to spend their summer seeing up close why we need more youth clubs and summer camps in Britain's poorest communities. But as Brexit continues to dominate the political agenda, disadvantaged kids are caught in this government policy blind spot, with no sign of things changing.
JUL21	The public can be incredibly cruel or incredibly kind to exhausted mothers. I've experienced both	This column is largely about motherhood. I’m letting you know upfront to give you the option to roll your eyes and slope off now without reading it, muttering that “you did the equivalent of pushing a watermelon through a tin whistle, as women have since the dawn of time – big wow”. As far as the wider world sees it, while a man with a papoose is adorable irrespective of whether he has it on the right way up, motherhood is something that throws you open to merciless judgement from all quarters. It can feel like nothing is ever quite right, whether it’s the food that you feed them, what you do to pay for it or the particular brand of subterfuge you use to trick them into going to sleep, and I know this partly because of all of the judging I myself have done over the years. These days, you can’t even announce your offspring’s SAT scores over a carelessly unattended playground Tannoy system without running the risk of being called “boastful”. But I am not sorry.

JUL21	The government needs to do more to protect victims of human trafficking	We are deeply concerned by the government’s response to a new report outlining the detention of 507 potential victims of human trafficking in 2018 alone. Last week the minister of state for immigration, Caroline Nokes MP, clarified that “479 [potential victims of trafficking] received a positive decision on reasonable grounds during a detention period” and that “422 people were released within a week”.

JUL21	I saw children being gassed on the Champs-Elysees last week – police violence in France is out of control	Even in a city as traditionally turbulent as Paris, recent scenes of police violence have been exceptionally shocking. Victims over the past few weeks have ranged from journalists and students to environmentalists and asylum seekers.  No matter what their background, or political persuasion, all have been viewed as legitimate targets for heavily armed paramilitaries trained to deal with any perceived threat to order with extreme brutality. These specialist riot control officers – and there are thousands of them – consider summer as a time when every type of undesirable takes to the streets, and they see nothing wrong with imposing their authority as harshly as possible.

JUL22	Both Democrats and Republicans will act like fools during Mueller's testimony this week, and there's a simple reason why	Robert Mueller's public testimony before two congressional committees is scheduled for Wednesday this week, and the circus surrounding it is in full swing.  While Mueller's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee will likely be fireworks-free, it's his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee that is likely to produce the kind of farcical theater both Republicans and Democrats are hoping for. 
JUL22	Jo Swinson has little time to celebrate her leadership – the Lib Dems need to develop their agenda beyond Brexit	Jo Swinson will have little time to celebrate after succeeding Sir Vince Cable to become the Liberal Democrats’ first woman leader. Swinson, who comfortably beat Sir Ed Davey by 47,997 votes to 28,021, insisted in a strong acceptance speech that “liberalism is alive and kicking”. She promised her party she would “take on nationalism and populism” and do “whatever it takes to stop Brexit”, but acknowledged they faced the fight of their lives. She made a good start at being a thorn in Boris Johnson’s side; one task will be to puncture his claims to be a liberal conservative.
JUL22	Keeping calm and carrying on? What’s really behind strong consumer spending in Brexit Britain	Britain’s economy has long had all of its eggs in one basket and that basket is not as sturdy as it looks.  I’m talking about the fact that spending by consumers – rather than, say, investment by businesses – accounts for over 60 per cent of our GDP. Judging by the latest official numbers, that engine of growth is still purring away happily. Retail sales unexpectedly rose in June, defying the gloom spreading through other parts of the economy.

JUL22	Legalising same-sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland will not just lift the fear and shame – it will remove handcuffs	Today Northern Ireland’s future has been re-written. After years of having our rights denied, our 158-year-long abortion ban is to be scrapped and same-sex marriage is to be legalised.   The Northern Ireland Bill has passed through its final stage, making it law by October this year unless a devolved Assembly is restored before that date.
JUL22	Trump is powering the UK’s preparations for war – it is he who needs to be deterred, not Iran	It’s about time we wised up to what is going on in this utterly farcical “crisis” in the Gulf, this charade of lies and pomposity which Trump and his doggies in London are presenting to us.  An American president who is a racist, misogynist, dishonest and psychologically disturbed man – assisted by two vicious and equally dishonourable and delusional advisers – is threatening to go to war with Iran while a kipper-waving and equally serial-lying buffoon, who is probably the future British prime minister, prefers to concentrate on the self-destruction of his country rather than the hijacking of his ships.
JUL22	If Boris Johnson can’t stomach young, anti no-deal Tories like me, he won’t get far with the rest of the electorate	A couple of weeks ago, I went to a “Back Boris” rally in Kent. I wasn’t there out of loyalty, to network, or even to hold Boris Johnson to account. What I was looking for was a sense of reassurance that my party, and my country, were in safe hands. I didn’t find it.  As a young Conservative, I am increasingly troubled by the direction my party is heading. Its descent into far-right euroscepticism, entirely divorced from concerns of evidence or fact, is a far cry from the moderate party representing sensible fiscal policy that I’ve been involved with since my first year at university. Its identity shift seems to be partly a wrongheaded attempt to beat Nigel Farage and his ex-Ukip-turned-Brexit-Party-base at their own game. The problem is, it isn’t working.
JUL22	Zelensky's victory in Ukraine is bad news for the oligarchs and a strategic loss for Putin	As Europe gets ready for its biggest nation in the west of Europe to say goodbye under a nationalist leadership, and a parliament unable to control the executive at the other end of Europe, the parliament of Ukraine has just been elected with serious hopes for the first time since the Berlin Wall fell that it can lead Ukraine out of bad politics and worse economics. Ukraine has had two revolutionary moments this century. First when its people arose in the 2004 Orange revolution in Kiev and then again in Maidan in Kiev in the winter of 2014/14.
JUL23	Donald Trump stole my mom and I wish she would come back	 I don’t have a mom anymore. Trump stole her. 
JUL23	It turns out Donald Trump does have a Roy Cohn, and it's Bill Barr	“Where’s my Roy Cohn?” Trump responded in a rage when Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. Trump felt that Sessions’ recusal showed a lack of loyalty instead of rare flash of ethics (the ethical thing was for Session to recuse himself from an investigation of a campaign in which he worked). Though it’s hard to accuse of Sessions of being completely ethical, that moment of doing the right thing was enough to raise the president’s ire.  Trump’s continued fury towards Sessions and complete lack of self-consciousness about his own behavior says so much. And let’s not forget that Roy Cohn was probably one of the most reprehensible figures of the 20th century. He was also likely the closest Donald Trump ever got to a having a friend or a dad. 
JUL23	Mueller isn't about to become a Democrat ally — the sooner we accept that, the better	Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller III’s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee this week is the beginning of the end — for better or worse.  Mueller’s investigation encompassed nearly two years of branching investigations into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election and Donald Trump’s alleged, potentially criminal, attempts to derail the special prosecutor’s work. Through it all, Mueller has maintained trademark silence — to heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. 
JUL23	I thought I was being ‘blacklisted’ by university colleagues, so I demanded to see their emails	Blacklisting at work has been illegal in the UK since 2010, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. It just happens informally. I know, because it happened to me.  I was a recent PhD graduate at the time, and as far as I can tell, academic ‘blacklisting’ plays out in similar ways to the regular kind. When it happens, you generally know something is wrong, although you probably won’t know what, at least to start with. You will apply for hundreds of jobs, but rarely, if ever, be shortlisted. You will account for some of this by blaming bad luck. You’ll tell yourself it’s a numbers game, or the economy is bad, or there are too many applicants chasing too few jobs.

JUL23	Donald Trump won hearts and minds in Pakistan this week — and we know he needs our help	The first one-on-one meeting of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and US president Donald Trump in the White House on Monday marked a new beginning in the complicated relationship between the two countries. It’s no secret that the US and Pakistan haven’t seen eye-to-eye over the last few years. Since the Cold War, diplomacy has been strained; events like 9/11 almost stretched them beyond breaking point. The Trump-Khan meeting this week, however, ushered in the possibility of repairing US-Pakistan relations for good. The meeting seemed to go amicably; Pakistani outlets responded positively. One moment triggered particular debate internationally: the moment when Donald Trump said of the Kashmir dispute, “If I can help, I’d love to be a mediator.”
JUL23	Boris is finally PM, but will he be the liberal conservative or the reckless no-dealer?	After Theresa May’s long goodbye, Boris Johnson’s short honeymoon will begin. His premiership may well be shaped by decisions in the next few days. Fittingly, the traditional 100-day period for judging a new prime minister ends on 31 October – the date Britain is due to exit the EU. Johnson has achieved his lifelong ambition, even if it stops short of being “world king” (as he told his sister Rachel he wanted to be as a child). Naturally, he doesn’t remember that now. Similarly, the man who talks about his Turkish great grandfather to show he is pro-immigration, does not recall warning about the risks of Turkey joining the EU during the 2016 referendum.
JUL23	There’s still time for the Queen and Theresa May to kill Boris Johnson’s no-deal Brexit – here’s how	On Wednesday, Theresa May will travel the short distance across London to present her resignation to the Queen. It is part of Britain’s democratic ritual, but it also offers an opportunity, however remote, for democratic innovation. That meeting between arguably the two most powerful people in the land need not necessarily be the rubber-stamping exercise we expect, and there remains a constitutional avenue which could stymie Boris Johnson’s plans for a no-deal Brexit.
JUL23	Boris Johnson’s victory speech: what he said – and what he really meant	What Boris Johnson said: I want to begin by thanking my opponent, Jeremy, by common consent an absolutely formidable campaigner. You’ve been friendly, you’ve been good natured, you’ve been a font of excellent ideas, all of which I propose to steal forthwith. What he really meant: Gracious towards weak opponent manoeuvred into position by my fixers to avoid a confrontation with Traitor Gove: tick. 
JUL24	Broken Britain has met its breaker in Boris Johnson	Out of the jag, a gentle smirk. Mission accomplished. Broken Britain, gone to meet its breaker.  Prime minister Boris Johnson is the joke and we are now the punchline.
JUL24	Europe is burning just as new research offers a chilling truth about the volatility of climate change	It’s not the fall that will kill you, but the suddenness of the stopping. Just as it is with a plane crash, so it is with global heating. Changes in the climate don’t in themselves represent a significant risk – the Earth’s climate has been changing for billions of years after all – but it is the abrupt changes that could spell disaster for us.  New research suggests that climate models which predict greater global warming in the future also have more volatile warming trends. If that is the case, and the climate is as sensitive to our carbon dioxide emissions as many of the latest models suggest, this will seriously threaten our ability to adapt. And it is that which will put a significant fraction of humanity in jeopardy.

JUL24	It turns out Donald Trump does have a Roy Cohn, and it's Bill Barr	“Where’s my Roy Cohn?” Trump responded in a rage when Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. Trump felt that Sessions’ recusal showed a lack of loyalty instead of rare flash of ethics (the ethical thing was for Session to recuse himself from an investigation of a campaign in which he worked). Though it’s hard to accuse of Sessions of being completely ethical, that moment of doing the right thing was enough to raise the president’s ire.  Trump’s continued fury towards Sessions and complete lack of self-consciousness about his own behavior says so much. And let’s not forget that Roy Cohn was probably one of the most reprehensible figures of the 20th century. He was also likely the closest Donald Trump ever got to a having a friend or a dad. 
JUL24	Mueller isn't about to become a Democrat ally — the sooner we accept that, the better	Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller III’s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee this week is the beginning of the end — for better or worse.  Mueller’s investigation encompassed nearly two years of branching investigations into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election and Donald Trump’s alleged, potentially criminal, attempts to derail the special prosecutor’s work. Through it all, Mueller has maintained trademark silence — to heavy criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. 
JUL24	As an MP, here’s why my last question to Theresa May had nothing to do with Brexit	Today I had the dubious honour of being drawn for Theresa May's last ever prime minister's questions, exactly two years after I asked her my first one after delivering my maiden speech as a new MP.  A lot has happened in politics over that time, but each time I have been lucky in the draw to ask a question in my two years as an MP, I have used the opportunity to highlight a failure of this government which has directly impacted one of my constituents in Glasgow north east. Remote as No 10 Downing Street can appear to most people, the decisions made in that touch lives the length and breadth of the UK and today's question shows the people of Glasgow north east caught between a rock and a hard place.
JUL24	I helped to release the video of the uncontacted Amazon tribe – here's why	The man in the forest doesn’t know he’s being watched. He doesn’t know there’s a camera in the bushes following his every move. He doesn’t know that soon his face will be on the front of newspapers, that this secretly shot footage of him will be shared on social media channels worldwide. It seems wrong somehow, that this man does not know this, did not ask for it and did not consent to it. Is it ok to keep watching him? Suddenly, he catches sight of the camera and runs away as fast as he can. Spying on people from the bushes seems profoundly distasteful, but in this very unique instance, this footage will actually help save this man’s life, and the lives of others like him. He is a member of a tribe called the Awá, and his group of Awá people have chosen to remain uncontacted, avoiding all interaction with the dominant society. 
JUL24	Trump could be the clown who solves the 70-year Kashmir crisis. India and Pakistan should let him try	Few places so mesmerising carry the pain of Kashmir. The Himalayan region, contested for seven decades by India and Pakistan, has been a hideout for Islamabad-backed militants; witnessed the forced expulsion of a Hindu community as authorities did nothing; and seen a Muslim-majority area become home to 500,000 Indian troops reportedly responsible for widespread abuses. It is place burdened both by history and the desire for something better.
JUL24	Prepare for the age of Boris anxiety – Britain’s underqualified PM is going to play havoc with our mental health	Within minutes of Boris Johnson being announced as the UK’s new prime minister, social media was flooded with despair. People joked that they were going to “head outside and scream” to deal with their anger and frustration. Jokes aside – although there is really nothing to laugh about – this is only the start of the distress to come.
JUL25	Robert Mueller's testimony did not provide the fireworks the Democrats were after – impeachment is still unlikely	Democrats got the answers they needed out of Robert Mueller when it came to the case of impeaching Donald Trump – but it's doubtful that the answers will lead to action. No, Mueller’s report did not exonerate the president of potentially obstructing the Russia investigation. And yes, the Trump campaign knew they would likely be the beneficiaries of interference in the 2016 election from Moscow.
JUL25	Boris Johnson will learn the hard way that there’s no winning in backing deal and no-deal Brexit at the same time	The UK hasn’t held a winter general election since February 1974. There were two elections that year, as Labour’s Harold Wilson succeeded Edward Heath’s Conservatives, but the second on 10 October was before the clocks went back. Since then, elections have been held either in April, May or June. Winter elections were avoided because dark evenings and the risk of bad weather made it harder to get out the vote. But I have a feeling we are heading for our first winter contest since 1974 after Boris Johnson’s dramatic cabinet reshuffle and his Commons statement today. Johnson would probably prefer to seek his own mandate in his own time next spring, after taking the UK out of the EU. But some of his allies concede privately that a November election could be on the cards, either because parliament blocks no deal and he decides to seek the voters’ approval for it, or he loses a confidence vote and is forced to go to the country.
JUL25	Genocides begin in the wilderness, far from prying eyes – in Ottoman Turkey as well as Nazi Germany	Many believe the Jewish Holocaust was planned by the Nazis at a Berlin lakeside villa at Wannsee on 20 January 1942. Most historians still think the Armenian Holocaust was hatched up by the Ottoman Turks in Istanbul in 1915. Of course, we’ve long known that the mass slaughter of Europe’s Jews began the moment the Germans crossed the Polish border on 1 September 1939 – and carried on across the Soviet Union in 1941, seven months before Wannsee.  But now, almost incredibly, we discover that the liquidation of Christian Armenian men, women and children was first instigated on 1 December 1914 in the far away city of Erzurum – not on 24 April 1915, when Armenians commemorate the first killings of the genocide perpetrated against them. And that back in that fatal December month, the Turkish “Special Organisation” – the Ottoman equivalent of the later German SS and Einsatzgruppen – organised the immediate liquidation of Armenians “liable to carry out attacks against Muslims”.
JUL25	Schizophrenia has haunted my mum’s life – it’s time the Mental Health Act gave her the freedom she deserves	One of my earliest memories is Mum setting fire to the carpet in the living room of our house. She wasn’t trying to hurt herself or take her own life. She was trying to keep us warm, because she couldn’t get the heating to work and we were cold.

JUL25	While we fry in a brutal heatwave, let's remember that climate change is all our fault	Here in the UK, we love to talk about the weather – in fact, we’re famous for it. We’re also prone to front pages and social media posts that celebrate a heatwave as great fun for all the family – “phew, what a scorcher!” But right now, our temperatures are more than just chat and clickbait. For the second summer in a row, records are tumbling as the mercury climbs. Of course, lots of us enjoy basking in the rays – particularly when we’re on holiday, but tropical temperatures at home are another matter. These ever hotter and ever more frequent heatwaves are nothing to celebrate. In fact, they’re cause for alarm, because the climate crisis and climate change makes extreme weather events like these both likelier and more intense.
JUL25	Sajid Javid may have the unenviable job of being chancellor – but he still managed to dodge the worst posts in cabinet	The government’s economic portfolios? They’re the ones most likely to get bitten by the reality of the no-deal Brexit our new prime minister is apparently set upon. And they aren’t the prizes they might seem to be.  Still, let’s at least credit BoZo the clown with getting one thing right now he’s taken up residence in No 10. He’s appointed the ideal chancellor for creating the magic money trees we were told we were told didn’t exist. 
JUL25	Why Jo Swinson’s no-confidence motion is good for her, even better for Boris, and bad news for Corbyn	Full marks, then, to Jo Swinson for tabling her very own motion of no confidence in Her Majesty’s government. A few days into the job and she’s already taken a fine opportunity to build a bit of profile and make a name for herself among the voting public, most of whom are still very unfamiliar with her. As an alternative to going on I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, Strictly or Bake Off, it has much to commend it. It will fail, of course. Also a matter of a few days into his new job, Boris Johnson will make light work of it. He still commands a majority, with the DUP, in the Commons and not even the most BoJosceptic critic of his in the commons will vote against him at this stage. It will suit Mr Johnson just fine – the DUDE mantra will be repeated, a few jokes, and then off for a decent meal at his favourite Italian restaurant.
JUL25	Mueller’s testimony today proved Republicans now have greater loyalty to Trump than their country	President Trump has spent the last week questioning the patriotism of four congresswomen of colour. Today, his lack of patriotism was put under a spotlight on Capitol Hill. After over two years of disinformation being disseminated from Donald Trump’s Twitter feed, and lies subsequently perpetuated by Attorney General William Barr and conservative media, we have finally heard from the man himself. In his 89th appearance before Congress, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before the House Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees and showcased to the American people the extent of Donald Trump‘s deceptive corruption.
JUL26	If the rumours are true, Boris’s social care plan is so bad he’d be better off not having one at all	Promising a fix for our broken social care system has become a right of passage for new prime ministers in recent times. From Blair to May, social care has consistently been a priority; at least in rhetoric if not in reality. Now, in his inaugural speech, Boris Johnson, has followed suit, committing to give “every older person the dignity and security they deserve” by solving the care crisis “once and for all”. Many will be quick to dismiss this claim. After all, failing to deliver on their social care commitments is also a right of passage for new prime ministers. Over the last two decades we have had a staggering 12 government reviews into how we fund and reform social care and 13 government ministers – but we still do not have a sustainable solution.
JUL26	Absence makes the heart grow fonder – a winter Love Island will ruin it for all of us	The end of a Love Island series is always an emotional time for fans. Yes, we get our evenings back, but it’s always tempered by the realisation that we will have to wait a whole year to once again get our fix. Or not, as the case may be. On Monday, ITV announced that the dating show would be returning not once, but twice in 2020, with an additional series set in sunny South Africa set to air post-Christmas.
JUL26	The Top 10: Fun Plurals	This idea was from Max Tundra, who offered the odd-numbered ones. Steve Hacking suggested there must be two of him: Max Tundrae.  1. Volkswagen Golves. Boris Aguilera also suggested Volkswagen Poli. Mark Goldsack mentioned Ford Foci.

JUL26	As a gay football referee, here's what the ‘Gay footballer’ Twitterstorm reveals about homophobia in football	In August 2017, I was the first gay football referee in the professional league to state publicly that I’m a gay man. With this in mind, the recent “Gay Footballer” Twitter account has impacted me both personally and professionally. @FootballerGay is a Twitter account that appeared recently which claimed to be run by a Championship footballer who intended to come out as gay. The account’s profile stated that the alleged player was a “proud gay man” and posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. As more attention surrounded the account, it quickly amassed over 50,000 followers. Then, sensationally, it tweeted saying that today (24 July) would be the day the player’s identity was revealed.  
JUL26	Next time, just send an email. Jared O’Mara MP’s aide chose the wrong moment for a public shaming	Jared O’Mara has, undeniably, not been the MP that Sheffield Hallam deserves.  It took him more than a year after his election in 2017 to make his maiden speech in the Commons. He has a history of making sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic remarks online – although he has since apologised, and the comments do date back to the early 2000s. Frustratingly, he is still yet to hold a by-election, despite resigning the Labour ticket he was elected on over a year ago.
JUL26	Nicola Sturgeon will be rubbing her hands as Boris tilts the scales towards Scottish independence	They say a week is a long time in politics, but for those to the left of centre, this one has been as bleak as it has been long. Boris Johnson is prime minister and Priti Patel is now the most powerful woman in the UK (with apologies to the Queen). Jacob Rees-Mogg is leader of the House of Commons, Dominic Raab is representing us on the international stage and Esther McVey is in charge of solving the housing crisis. Things have certainly been better.
JUL26	A letter to the UK about Boris Johnson from a White House reporter who's spent the last year covering Trump	Dear Downing Street Press: You woke up on Wednesday to find that Her Majesty's Government was now led by a bombastic New York-born, straw-haired man from a wealthy family who, nevertheless, made his political bones as a self-styled populist and who is using close relatives as advisers. I know how you feel.
JUL26	When it comes to Boris Johnson and his X-Men of liars, the truth is the last thing that will set us free	This cabinet Boris Johnson has put together is only the start. When he’s settled he’ll have Bernie Ecclestone at transport; General Franco at defence; a bloke who was in the Question Time audience in Sunderland who got so angry shouting “just get on with it” his hair caught fire as minister for communities; the Society of Deposed Central American Generals will share culture and sport and a chap from the year above at Eton will get agriculture as a little thank you for spanking him every Wednesday. But he’s not done badly so far. Because most of the prominent posts have not just gone to normal lying politicians, but to people who have been sacked for lying or found guilty of lying in court.

JUL27	Misogyny, corruption and leaked messages: the story of the demise of Puerto Rico’s governor	When Ricardo Rossello took to Facebook at the 11th hour on 24 July to become the first Puerto Rican Governor to resign from office, he had been hit with 12 straight days of public protest. It was some 48 hours after a 500,000 strong crowd marched in the capital of a country with population of about 3.2 million. But the seeds of his political undoing had been planted years before, some say from birth. The 40-year-old biomedical engineering PhD and married father of two had served two and a half years of his four-year term as the 12th governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico. His election made history, since he was the first son of a former governor, Pedro Rossello Gonzalez, to also be elected to the island’s highest public office. Puerto Rico has been a territory of the United States since 1898 and, in 1952, it was granted a self-governing political system modelled after its owner, featuring a republican, three-branch power structure centred around a strong executive branch.
JUL27	I’ve been inside Amazon’s new hi-tech warehouses – and I’ve seen how robots will change how we work	I recently visited an Amazon fulfilment centre in Tilbury, Essex. LCY2, as it is called, is a “ninth generation” site, meaning it is the company’s most up-to-date, and is operated 24 hours a day by workers and robots across a 2 million sq ft warehouse – around 28 football pitches. There have been a lot of changes since Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, who started the company shipping books from his garage in Seattle. Since then, the company has grown dramatically, shipping what feels like just about anything to homes worldwide. In the process, Bezos became the richest person in the world, with a net worth of over $100bn.

JUL27	A no-deal Brexit would be an opening shot in a Johnson and Trump-led economic cold war with the EU	Bluff was a central feature of British power even when the British empire covered a large part of the globe. A story illustrating this tells of a royal navy captain who was sent with a small ship to the far east to force a defiant local ruler to obey some orders issued by the British authorities. “What do I do if he refuses to do what I tell him?” the captain asked his superiors before departing. “We don’t have any more ships available, so you’ll just have to turn around and come home again,” was the less than comforting reply.

JUL28	Boris Johnson once called me a ‘shirt-lifter’ – decades later, has he built an anti-LGBT+ cabinet?	It was the end of the 1980s. I was dating a lovely man. I got to hang out with his friends. They weren’t my usual crowd. They were Conservatives and all from Oxford. We had different views, but I liked them. One night we ended up in a small private club in central London. Boris Johnson was there. My boyfriend wasn’t. The banter was fun. I was introduced to Johnson, already a force to be reckoned with, as the person going out with my boyfriend. “Oh that shirt-lifter,” Johnson affectionately replied. “What’s a shirt-lifter?” I asked. I’d never heard of such a thing. With gentle ribbing, it was explained to me. A decade or so later, I met Johnson again. He was a political figure by then. We were with mutual friends, and I regaled everyone with the story. The joke being on me and my naivety, not on Johnson. “I didn’t say that,” he declared.
JUL28	We need to talk about the rising wave of anti-Roma attacks in Europe	The Roma community is Europe’s largest and most persecuted minority. Since the arrival of their nomadic ancestors from the northern Indian subcontinent in the Middle Ages, Romani people have been subjected to intense periods of discrimination, from forced expulsions in the 16th century to Nazi genocide in Second World War. Throughout Europe, antiziganist (anti-Roma) prejudice has lingered on largely unscathed to this day. But as hate crimes and attacks against the continent’s 10-12 million Romani inhabitants are on the rise, it becomes increasingly vital for us to tackle the issue and openly acknowledge its existence. Far-right populism is gaining momentum across the west, and, unsurprisingly, it has been accompanied by an upsurge in attacks against Romani people. From France to Hungary, Roma communities and camps have been subjected to violence and threats.

JUL28	What if – horror of horrors – Boris Johnson made a success of Brexit?	So far, I have said that Boris Johnson is likely to be heading for disaster. He seems unlikely to get a Brexit deal through parliament, and parliament is unlikely to allow him to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.  Thus he seems to be heading for a “people against parliament” election, in which he asks the people for a mandate for his Brexit, saying he has been blocked by MPs. Who knows what would happen then, but such an election would take place against the background of Johnson’s failure to deliver the one thing on which he has staked his premiership: leaving by 31 October.

JUL29	Boris’s no-deal Brexit optimism won’t just land us an even messier divorce, it’ll push Scotland to file the papers too	As Boris Johnson should know better than most, divorces are always time-consuming, usually messy, and often bitter. So it is proving with the United Kingdom’s break-up with the European Union, after 45 years of uneasy marital life (ever-closer conjugal relations having long since been abandoned)...But, as they say, we must also think of the kids. In the case of this slightly stretched analogy – which isn’t meant to be condescending – that means Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It is not as if they could be, say, members of the EU on weekdays, and inside the UK at weekends. It’s tricky. So the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has despatched the “minister for the union”, Boris Johnson, on a grand, but rather brief, tour to reassure the kids that no-deal Brexit will actually bring our family of nations together, and tighten for “the ties that bind the UK”, as he puts it.
JUL29	Many would have you believe the working class is reactionary and right wing – but this research disproves that	There is an assumption in British politics that being poor makes you right wing. Polling that uses the Nation Readership Survey's definition of “working class” - skilled workers, unskilled workers, the precariously employed, pensioners and unemployed, the so-called “C2Des” - persistently reports this grouping's disproportionate support for Ukip and the Brexit Party, and preference for the Conservatives over Labour. Indeed, something of a cottage industry, dubbed Blue Labour, has made a splash by arguing Labour has become more metropolitan and liberal, and therefore alienating "socially conservative" workers outside London and in the north.
JUL29	Tunisia is a shining example of democracy in a world hellbent on backsliding into chaos – why is the west ignoring it?	This week, after Tunisia’s first democratically elected president died inside a military hospital in the capital at the age of 92, the country came together in mourning. Though a polarising figure who represented first and foremost the interests of the north African country’s old guard and elite, Mohamed Caid Beji Essebsi was recognised by even his Islamist-rooted opponent Rachid Ghannouchi as a “patriot” as well as a major figure of Tunisian history.
JUL29	Trident is expensive and unwieldy – it’s time to spend our money elsewhere	The stand-off with Iran in the Gulf has brought into sharp focus the desperate shortage of ships in the Royal Navy. In consequence, we have had to call on our European partners (how ironic) to help with escorting our tankers.  I am reminded of what Admiral Nelson famously said after the Battle of the Nile: “Were I to die at this moment, want of frigates would be found stamped on my heart”  – a sentiment that his successors are publicly expressing today.

From France to Hungary, Roma communities and camps have been subjected to violence and threats. 
JUL29	I was indifferent about toxic masculinity for most of my life – until I was assaulted	In March 2019, I was sexually assaulted on my morning commute to work. I never thought it would happen to me, and if I had ever thought about it being an issue, I always imagined being one of those brave women who would fight back and publicly shame their attacker.
JUL29	Why the Unite to Remain alliance is our best bet at taking down no-deal Brexit	This month, we saw the happy arrival of Unite to Remain. Something I feel the country has been crying out for.    Unite to Remain is a new organisation dedicated to ensuring that the majority of Britons who now want to remain in the EU can cast their votes in the next general election in the most effective way to deliver that outcome. 
JUL29	Africa and Asia will propel the world’s population towards 10 billion – but are their food systems ready?	Talk of the global population reaching 10 billion by 2050 has been around for some time. Yet, this statistic actually hides the real source of this growth, and its implications. Only two regions – sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia – will contribute the lion’s share of this new headcount. Indeed, elsewhere in the world, populations will mostly either plateau or even decline.
JUL29	The Home Office is locking up victims of slavery. Will Priti Patel do the right thing and end this cruelty?	The new home secretary has the opportunity to make a real difference to trafficking victims’ lives: she can end the practice of locking them up in immigration detention. It beggars belief that the UK would take away the liberty of people who’ve experienced severe exploitation – but it’s happening. Aside from being morally unacceptable, this also puts the UK potentially in breach of international obligations on our responsibilities towards victims, including the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and the EU Victims’ Rights Directive.
JUL29	Boris Johnson once called me a ‘shirt-lifter’ – decades later, has he built an anti-LGBT+ cabinet?	It was the end of the 1980s. I was dating a lovely man. I got to hang out with his friends. They weren’t my usual crowd. They were Conservatives and all from Oxford. We had different views, but I liked them. One night we ended up in a small private club in central London. Boris Johnson was there. My boyfriend wasn’t. The banter was fun. I was introduced to Johnson, already a force to be reckoned with, as the person going out with my boyfriend. “Oh that shirt-lifter,” Johnson affectionately replied. “What’s a shirt-lifter?” I asked. I’d never heard of such a thing. With gentle ribbing, it was explained to me. A decade or so later, I met Johnson again. He was a political figure by then. We were with mutual friends, and I regaled everyone with the story. The joke being on me and my naivety, not on Johnson. “I didn’t say that,” he declared.
JUL30	Boris Johnson angers Ireland at his peril – a US trade deal could hinge on the Irish power base in the Democrats	Relax Britain, who needs Brussels? Donald Trump is going to offer “a very substantial trade deal” through which we can do “three, four, five times what we’re doing”. Go Boris! Go Donald! The president’s words were music to the ears of backers of his British mini-me, despite the inconvenient fact that, even if Trump is right, that would still amount to a mere fraction of the trade we do with the EU, which is gravely threatened by the Tories taking us on a dystopian acid trip. 
JUL30	Is Dominic Cummings really a political genius? Hardly. He may be Boris Johnson’s biggest mistake yet	What actually is Dominic Cummings’ record as a vote-winning guru? So far has he has fought campaigns in which the outcome was foretold. His first entry into political campaigning was for Business for Sterling, set up 20 years ago to keep the pound. But it was a fake issue: In 1997, Tony Blair had matched John Major’s election promise of a referendum on euro entry. There was never the faintest chance that Blair, in his first or any government, was going to risk a referendum on the euro in which he knew would crash to defeat.
JUL30	How the global media was duped into blaming two non-existent ‘North African’ suspects for stabbing an Italian policeman	Italian politics got quite strange last weekend. I was first aware of this on Saturday, when my Twitter started twanging to the sound of a far right politician rowing back on some hatred. That is a rare event, and cause for celebration, even if the proximate cause for the froth was appalling human tragedy and a salutary lesson in how irresponsible journalism can foment hate. It began with the brutal murder of Mario Cerciello Rega, a 35-year-old vice-brigadier in the carabinieri, on duty in the Prati district of Rome, in the early hours of 26 July. Within hours – by 9am in most cases – the Italian press had it sorted.
JUL30	Pakistan has a domestic abuse problem – but there’s a way to turn the outrage into action	Several years ago, at my uncle’s funeral, a distant relative next to me, whispered: “Good riddance. His poor wife is finally free.” Struck by newly palpable grief, her words choked me. How could someone be callous enough to curse the dead even before they were buried? My uncle – as it turned out – was a chronic wife-beater and my aunt, a brave yet convention-bound woman. More than a decade later, as #saynotodomesticviolence gains virality in Pakistan, I recalled those words. Should my aunt have confided in someone? Is there something we had missed? Would I offer newfound advice to my daughters? But first, what even comprises domestic violence? Is the “see what you made me do” alibi legitimate? And beyond the blame-game, how do we fix things? These questions are complex, unsettling, and Pakistani society has mostly shirked them. 
JUL30	We are trying to renew British politics and strike a blow for democracy – now we need your help	Our democracy is under threat and needs a shot in the arm if it is to be fit for coming generations. The Citizens’ Convention on UK Democracy intends to do just that. The Convention will run an ambitious, impartial, two-year deliberation on democratic reform in the UK. The first stage of the process begins today, with plans for how we will create a new and effective interface between the public and politicians. This project is about creating a vibrant process, and not blinkered campaigning for specific policy reforms. The policies that emerge will come from our citizen participants.
JUL30	Many would have you believe the working class is reactionary and right wing – but this research disproves that	There is an assumption in British politics that being poor makes you right wing. Polling that uses the Nation Readership Survey's definition of “working class” - skilled workers, unskilled workers, the precariously employed, pensioners and unemployed, the so-called “C2Des” - persistently reports this grouping's disproportionate support for Ukip and the Brexit Party, and preference for the Conservatives over Labour. Indeed, something of a cottage industry, dubbed Blue Labour, has made a splash by arguing Labour has become more metropolitan and liberal, and therefore alienating "socially conservative" workers outside London and in the north.
JUL30	Russia’s violent crackdown sets the tone for Putin’s remaining years, and issues a challenge to the west	As Russian President Vladimir Putin climbed into a miniature submarine and descended to the seabed in the Gulf of Finland on Saturday, Russian authorities proceeded with a violent and coordinated crackdown on unsanctioned protests in Moscow ahead of the September elections to Moscow’s municipal parliament. 
JUL30	Boris’s no-deal Brexit optimism won’t just land us an even messier divorce, it’ll push Scotland to file the papers too	As Boris Johnson should know better than most, divorces are always time-consuming, usually messy, and often bitter. So it is proving with the United Kingdom’s break-up with the European Union, after 45 years of uneasy marital life (ever-closer conjugal relations having long since been abandoned)...But, as they say, we must also think of the kids. In the case of this slightly stretched analogy – which isn’t meant to be condescending – that means Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It is not as if they could be, say, members of the EU on weekdays, and inside the UK at weekends. It’s tricky. So the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has despatched the “minister for the union”, Boris Johnson, on a grand, but rather brief, tour to reassure the kids that no-deal Brexit will actually bring our family of nations together, and tighten for “the ties that bind the UK”, as he puts it.
JUL30	Manchester had the perfect response to Boris – they know his no-deal Brexit could lay waste to the north	Egotists like Trump, Johnson and Farage need the roar of the crowd to validate their egos. The most telling moment of Boris Johnson’s speech on Saturday at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum, was when he beseeched the audience: “feel free to applaud.” His plea came after his re-announcements of the high-speed rail link between Leeds and Manchester, and more money for towns, fell flat and was met with silence. And who could blame the audience for shrugging at his cod-Churchillian rhetoric? For them it was deja vu.

Something I feel the country has been crying out for.    Unite to Remain is a new organisation dedicated to ensuring that the majority of Britons who now want to remain in the EU can cast their votes in the next general election in the most effective way to deliver that outcome. 
JUL31	Labour is laying out the red carpet for Boris Johnson – and Corbyn’s timid Brexit policy is to blame	The Labour Party needs to talk about… Boris. Surprisingly, it seemed unprepared for Boris Johnson taking power, even though it was hardly a surprise when he won the Tory leadership. I see little evidence of a Labour strategy on Boris. A new prime minister will always set the media agenda, and Boris is big enough to dominate it. Yet Labour has been missing in action in his first week. I suspect some Labour figures bank on Johnson being unpopular – that he is Boris Mark II after the divisive 2016 referendum, rather than the Mark I version who twice won a mayoral election in Labour-leaning London.
JUL31	Dominic Cummings is a fantasist without an adequate Brexit plan – so much for being a ‘political genius’	Among the many appointments to Boris Johnson’s government, few generated more intrigue than that of Dominic Cummings. The former Michael Gove staffer and Vote Leave director reportedly only accepted the adviser role at No 10 after deciding to postpone an operation until after Brexit day, further buttressing his self-made reputation for single-minded commitment to his causes. Cummings also cultivates his profile through a blog which over the years has combined lengthy tributes to scientific discoveries with quotable invective aimed at his many political enemies. His account of government mixes critique of Whitehall dysfunction and praise for “the error-correcting institutions of science and markets” with historical anecdotes of individuals Cummings considers brilliant; Bismarck is a particular favourite, as is – oddly – Jean Monnet, among the key figures behind the foundation of the EU.

JUL31	America needs a political revolution. Last night, Sanders and Warren showed that it’s ready for one	Before Tuesday night’s Democratic debate, the first of two this week, the issue on everyone’s mind was not healthcare or the humanitarian crisis at the border, it was finding the best strategy to motivate Americans to vote Trump out of office. Would a centre- or left-leaning candidate be better equipped to bring the voters out?  With Amy Klobuchar, Tim Ryan, John Delaney, and Steve Bullock angling themselves as moderates, the focus was on Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders – and, to a lesser extent, Pete Buttigieg – to see how far left they would go. 
JUL31	If a no-deal Brexit happens, mega corporations could sue the government for billions in secret courts	Imagine a world where transnational corporations don’t have to follow the same laws as everyone else, but instead have their own corporate courts, where the law is tailored to their interests. Not courts where the companies are put on trial, but where corporations sue governments for huge sums of money and bully countries to get their own way. It sounds like dystopian science fiction, but corporate courts are real. Formally known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), this shadowy legal system for transnational companies is written into the rules of many trade and investment deals.
JUL31	This Labour Party row will not be settled by relying on a flawed and faulty definition of antisemitism	Earlier this year the Equality & Human Rights Commission was asked to rule on whether the Labour Party has "unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish." To investigate this complaint the EHRC will need to consider whether there is any objective yardstick against which the complaint might be benchmarked. On the face of it, there is: namely the “Working Definition” of antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in 2016. 
JUL31	Boris Johnson angers Ireland at his peril – a US trade deal could hinge on the Irish power base in the Democrats	Relax Britain, who needs Brussels? Donald Trump is going to offer “a very substantial trade deal” through which we can do “three, four, five times what we’re doing”. Go Boris! Go Donald!

AUG1	Lies and buffoonery: How Boris Johnson’s fantasy world casts dark shadows in the Middle East	I’ve worked out that in the past week, I’ve been told to wait “only five minutes” at least four times. In the Arab world, any interview that is delayed will always be accompanied by the assurance that I will only have to wait for five minutes. Or I will be called back on the phone in just five minutes. Only very occasionally is it 10 minutes. Almost never one minute. It’s five – used more in Egypt, less so in Lebanon and Syria. In Arabic, “only five minutes” is – my transliteration – khams daqiya faqat. In 43 years, I calculate I must have heard the phrase almost 9,000 times, probably more. It’s a 99 per cent lie, of course, a lie every bit as big as the average percentage vote for an Arab dictator at election time. But I always – still – believe it. Even today, I will wait in a secretary’s office in the Middle East or glance at my phone and say to myself, ah well, it’s only three more minutes now and he/she will see me or ring back. He or she doesn’t. I know he/she won’t. But in the willing suspension of disbelief, five minutes must have credibility. 
AUG1	Bad for the environment, awful for our health and terrible for public space – this is the case for banning cars	As the magnitude of the climate crisis finally dawns on Britain, one development we should all be pleased to welcome is the end of the automobile age. Yes, the dominion of the private car over the public realm is officially out of road. Any effective response to the environmental emergency will need Britain to reverse our 70-year trend for more and more cars every year. There are now nearly 40 million internal combustion engine vehicles in the UK, which explains why transport today accounts for a third of our greenhouse gas emissions. 
AUG1	On the edge of Europe: The violence and filth of a camp in Bosnia defines the EU's legacy on refugees	Overlooked by the forested peaks of the Dinaric mountains on the border of the European Union, and surrounded by minefields from the Yugoslav wars, the Vučjak refugee camp in northwest Bosnia is a shocking reminder of the crisis bumping up against the back door of Europe.  Here, conditions pose serious health risks to hundreds of would-be asylum seekers. The United Nations recently described this camp, a few kilometers from Croatia, as “entirely inadequate for the purpose of accommodating people”.  
AUG1	America could be on the verge of war - watching the Democratic debates you'd never know it	 For the second night in a row, the Democratic debate included only a few minutes of discussion on foreign policy. And even those few minutes did not involve much debate. It consisted of a few general questions that demanded short answers.
AUG1	I worked for Gay Star News – the anti-trans lobby’s celebration of its closure is sickening	I lost my job this week in the most dramatic fashion. Our company directors told us on Monday the business had no money, they could not pay our wages and would soon go into insolvency.
AUG1	Pakistan has a domestic abuse problem – but there’s a way to turn the outrage into action	Several years ago, at my uncle’s funeral, a distant relative next to me, whispered: “Good riddance.

AUG1	Don’t listen to the Brexiteer bluff – Ireland is not to blame for their disaster	The Brexiteers have always said that their main aim is to “take back control”. What they clearly don’t want to take back is responsibility. For long enough, they sat back and let Theresa May’s government take the wheel, happy to jeer and shake their fists from the back seat. Now that they themselves are in the front, the Remainers can no longer be posed as public enemy number one. They have very quickly been replaced by Ireland.
AUG1	Brexit may have been the making of Boris Johnson – but this is why it will also be his undoing	Prime minister Boris Johnson spared no time in sacking a record number of ministers to create his no-deal cabinet. He has reformed his Vote Leave campaign band for a reunion tour with co-chair Michael Gove as deputy and strategist Dominic Cummings as chief of staff. These changes bring the quick win for Johnson’s supporters of showing a clear break from the more centrist Tory governments of the past led by David Cameron and Theresa May. Those who backed Boris will feel he’s honouring his promise to make Brexit happen by Halloween. But I’m afraid the real picture is more trick than treat.
AUG1	Boris Johnson is a clever politician, so I never feared seeing him in 10 Downing Street... until this week	Over the years, and especially around Boris Johnson’s first leadership attempt in 2016, I would note in conversation that I thought he was an incredibly intelligent man. I’ve said it again recently, too, and each time the response has been either a peal of laughter or immediate dismissal.  I stand by it. Johnson has always been a man with a plan.
AUG1	If a no-deal Brexit happens, mega corporations could sue the government for billions in secret courts	Imagine a world where transnational corporations don’t have to follow the same laws as everyone else, but instead have their own corporate courts, where the law is tailored to their interests.

AUG2	The opposition in Russia can defeat Putin – but only if its message chimes with an impoverished country	This should have been a boring summer in Moscow as far as politics were concerned. Moscow city council, with elections scheduled for 8 September, is not an especially important or influential body. Real power is concentrated in the hands of Moscow’s popular mayor, Sergei Sobianin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The mayor's office’s strategy was to “depoliticise” the elections. The unpopular United Russia party brand was put to one side, as the authorities decided to run their candidates as independents. The focus was supposed to be on local issues such as public amenities, transport, safety - issues where Moscow under Sobianin is generally thought to be doing rather well.
AUG2	Trump, Kushner and Netanyahu are hellbent on destroying the two-state solution – the EU must not let them	This week, Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team have been touring the Middle East to push his new $50bn economic plan, unveiled in Bahrain last month. The proposals aim to open the West Bank and Gaza to regional and global markets, developing the Palestinian economy. The US administration claims that within 10 years this strategy would double Palestinian economic output. While the US maintained the launch of the plan was a success, it received scathing press coverage and little recognition by the international community. Crucially, neither the Palestinian Authority (PA) nor the Israeli government were represented, and other important players like the EU, Egypt and Jordan only sent low-level delegations.

AUG2	In the Democrat race for 2020, Marianne Williamson is proving to be more than the sum of her parts	One of the most valuable legacies of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is that it’ll never be as exciting as it was then for women and people of colour to run for president. That’s an incredible achievement.  Thanks to Bernie Sanders’s 2016 run, the same goes for soft-socialist policy talk, not long ago verboten in mainstream US discourse. But while progressives should take heart at the sight of the most diverse field American politics has ever seen, isn’t it depressing how quickly it’s all become, well, boring? 
AUG2	Lies and buffoonery: How Boris Johnson’s fantasy world casts dark shadows in the Middle East	I’ve worked out that in the past week, I’ve been told to wait “only five minutes” at least four times.

AUG2	Dominic Raab trades in ‘alternative facts’. Westminster will soon be as bad as the White House	Oh to be Dominic Raab. No, really. Just imagine what it must be like to have a job that allows you to sod off somewhere a long way away when things are getting hot in your backyard.  If only we could persuade him to stay put in Bangkok, where he’s busy dribbling about trade opportunities as his friends press on with their plans to put up walls between us and our biggest market as part of a no-deal Brexit for which there is no democratic mandate.

AUG3	The Dutch ‘burqa ban’ collides with reality, and should make governments think again about policing dress	When I stood as an independent candidate in the Tower Hamlets’ mayoral elections of 2015, a white man asked me what colour my hair was under my veil. I said it was pink. He smiled, so then I added, “Not really, it’s green.” It was a small moment, but it got me thinking. I wrote an article – My Hair is Pink Under This Veil – and delivered a talk at Cambridge University. Muslim women have endured all manner of law makers, politicians, and the public, giving them fashion tips. They think they’re trying to empower us. The former leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, claimed that community relations would be improved if they ditched the veil; former prime minister David Cameron commented that Muslim women were “traditionally submissive”.
AUG3	Let's suck the glamour from the car industry – and save our cities – by killing off its cretinous marketing	A spell has been cast over our streets. Cars hold such an enchanted place in our society that we structure entire cities and housing developments around them, devote vast sums of public money to the roads they need to move around on, and celebrate the companies that make them. We anthropomorphise cars in fiction and in real-life, giving them cutesy names and mourning their loss to the scrapyard as if they were a beloved member of our family. We go to car shows and print them onto children’s t-shirts. At the root of this is the fact that cars are still regarded as status symbols – a sign of wealth, success and power. 
AUG3	Unless queer women write their own stories, the likes of Holby City will continue to kill gays for sport	In a bizarre twist to a plot that didn’t exist, the hospital soap Holby City decided to “bury a gay” it had already written out months ago. In the 30 July episode “Things My Mother Told Me”, a group of mostly strangers bid farewell to the immensely popular lesbian character, the ex-army trauma surgeon Bernie Wolfe, played by Jemma Redgrave.  Bernie, during her on-off stint on the series, had befriended and fallen in love with fellow surgeon Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell), and this middle-aged lesbian romance was once hailed as the groundbreaking fairy tale that lesbian viewers had always wanted. But it is always dangerous to be a fairy tale in the land of soaps – and if you are a gay couple, anywhere on television, since you have a disproportionately higher likelihood of either breaking up, one of you dying, or having to sacrifice your relationship for the greater good.
AUG3	On the edge of Europe: The violence and filth of a camp in Bosnia defines the EU's legacy on refugees	Overlooked by the forested peaks of the Dinaric mountains on the border of the European Union, and surrounded by minefields from the Yugoslav wars, the Vučjak refugee camp in northwest Bosnia is a shocking reminder of the crisis bumping up against the back door of Europe.

AUG3	The Top 10: Things politicians have brandished in speeches	Suggested by Jonathan Isaby, after Boris Johnson waved a kipper at his final leadership election hustings.  1. Piece of paper: Neville Chamberlain. Heston aerodrome, 1938. “This morning I had another talk with the German chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine.” Nominated by Arieh Kovler, Phil Riley and Adrian McMenamin. 
AUG3	The pathetic harassment of Greta Thunberg by a grown man is a glimpse of the reality for disabled kids	“I have been a disabled person from birth and have experienced first-hand the special education system. In the 1960s it was all about segregation and a system that worked against disabled young people being able to achieve anything.” So says Sue Bott, who is the deputy chief executive of Disability Rights UK. 
AUG3	The Whaley Bridge dam collapse is terrifying – but it will soon be dwarfed by far greater eco-disasters	The phrase “I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life” has been uttered a great deal in the north of England this week. In some places an entire month’s rain fell in four hours. Small streams that are usually a few inches deep were transformed into raging torrents. Extensive flooding has swept away bridges, submerged roads and homes. While in some places the clean up has begun, Whaley Bridge has been evacuated in response to the partial collapse of Toddbrook Reservoir which overlooks it. If it bursts it would dump over a million tons of water onto the Derbyshire town that is home to more than 6,000 people. The water would then continue its rampage through villages along the River Goyt.
AUG3	Once, only Ethel off EastEnders had a pug. Now they're a fashion item and puppy farmers are making a killing	Where I live, dogs are so popular that, if I see someone out of the house without one, I wonder what they’re up to. I mean, this is Bulldog Britain – home of everything from beagles to lurchers, and from Greyfriars Bobby to Petra, Goldie, and Shep. But if you thought that man’s best friend had long-since maxed out its popularity, you might be surprised to learn that “celebrity dogs” have triggered a recent surge in demand. As ever, demand brings the opportunity for someone to make a few quid, and opportunity draws in opportunists – however unscrupulous. 
AUG3	Trump, Kushner and Netanyahu are hellbent on destroying the two-state solution – the EU must not let them	This week, Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his team have been touring the Middle East to push his new $50bn economic plan, unveiled in Bahrain last month. The proposals aim to open the West Bank and Gaza to regional and global markets, developing the Palestinian economy. The US administration claims that within 10 years this strategy would double Palestinian economic output. While the US maintained the launch of the plan was a success, it received scathing press coverage and little recognition by the international community. Crucially, neither the Palestinian Authority (PA) nor the Israeli government were represented, and other important players like the EU, Egypt and Jordan only sent low-level delegations.
AUG4	When it comes to mass shootings in America, there is no ‘staying safe’	“Stay safe!”  As I watch the news from my homeland unroll on Twitter, I see this phrase again and again. An imperative to those in Gilroy, in El Paso, in Dayton. Tweeted when a gunman is firing, when the ambulances unload into the hospitals and morgues, when the broken people of a broken town are picking up the pieces. “Stay safe!”
AUG4	Social media designs are becoming more streamlined – but they’re failing disabled people in the process	Rebranding online platforms from time to time is considered essential by marketers. But it’s also almost guaranteed to generate negative reactions from users. With this in mind, the outpouring of complaints about the new Twitter design that we’ve seen over the past few weeks will surprise no one – but for many disabled users, the problem is a serious one. Where others find the redesigned site annoying to use, we struggle to use it at all. What’s more, this is typical of a widespread problem with social media companies ignoring the needs of disabled users. In a context where design is heavily focused on looking good and encouraging users to engage with new features, the basic functionality essential to engagement is often overlooked. 
AUG4	Unless queer women write their own stories, the likes of Holby City will continue to kill gays for sport	In a bizarre twist to a plot that didn’t exist, the hospital soap Holby City decided to “bury a gay” it had already written out months ago. In the 30 July episode “Things My Mother Told Me”, a group of mostly strangers bid farewell to the immensely popular lesbian character, the ex-army trauma surgeon Bernie Wolfe, played by Jemma Redgrave.  Bernie, during her on-off stint on the series, had befriended and fallen in love with fellow surgeon Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell), and this middle-aged lesbian romance was once hailed as the groundbreaking fairy tale that lesbian viewers had always wanted. But it is always dangerous to be a fairy tale in the land of soaps – and if you are a gay couple, anywhere on television, since you have a disproportionately higher likelihood of either breaking up, one of you dying, or having to sacrifice your relationship for the greater good.
AUG4	The Top 10: Things politicians have brandished in speeches	Suggested by Jonathan Isaby, after Boris Johnson waved a kipper at his final leadership election hustings.  1. Piece of paper: Neville Chamberlain. Heston aerodrome, 1938. “This morning I had another talk with the German chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine.” Nominated by Arieh Kovler, Phil Riley and Adrian McMenamin. 
AUG4	Could Boris Johnson find an electoral high by legalising weed?	No one should be surprised if Boris Johnson were to announce a wish to legalise cannabis for recreational use.  Choosing to smoke would provide comfort to many in the event of a hard Brexit. Young voters might be seduced by an act of metropolitan liberalism. The outraged elderly who voted him in as leader comprise too small a group for him to worry about now. 
AUG4	Beyond Brexit, does Boris Johnson’s cycling legacy show a PM who could actually achieve something?	Do away with all private cars in London over the next decade, says Leo Murray. He has written a report for a green coalition (and an article for The Independent), which sets out a vision of the zero-carbon traffic chaos of the future, with bicycles, electric scooters, “e-tuk-tuks” (electric rickshaws), buses, taxis, trams and pedestrians competing for road space.  This is utopianism at its best: idealistic, dramatic and not too bothered about the practicalities. I like it because I don’t like cars and have never owned one. Murray is right to point out that cars are wasteful and dangerous and that cities shouldn’t be built around them. The average car spends 95 per cent of its time parked, and 20 square miles of London is given over to car parking. 
AUG4	Is CBD marketing giving people false hope in the quest towards the legalisation of cannabis?	Cannabidiol (CBD) products are popping up everywhere from beauty products to drinks and more. Like the gold rush, we now have cannabis fever with the market estimated to be worth £16bn over the next decade. It’s part of a push seen this week by MP David Lammy, who is convinced that as we obtain sanctioned access to medicinal cannabis, recreational access will and should surely follow. 
AUG4	The Dutch ‘burqa ban’ collides with reality, and should make governments think again about policing dress	When I stood as an independent candidate in the Tower Hamlets’ mayoral elections of 2015, a white man asked me what colour my hair was under my veil. I said it was pink. He smiled, so then I added, “Not really, it’s green.” It was a small moment, but it got me thinking. I wrote an article – My Hair is Pink Under This Veil – and delivered a talk at Cambridge University. Muslim women have endured all manner of law makers, politicians, and the public, giving them fashion tips. They think they’re trying to empower us. The former leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, claimed that community relations would be improved if they ditched the veil; former prime minister David Cameron commented that Muslim women were “traditionally submissive”.
AUG4	The pathetic harassment of Greta Thunberg by a grown man is a glimpse of the reality for disabled kids	“I have been a disabled person from birth and have experienced first-hand the special education system. In the 1960s it was all about segregation and a system that worked against disabled young people being able to achieve anything.” So says Sue Bott, who is the deputy chief executive of Disability Rights UK. 
AUG4	The Whaley Bridge dam collapse is terrifying – but it will soon be dwarfed by far greater eco-disasters	The phrase “I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life” has been uttered a great deal in the north of England this week. In some places an entire month’s rain fell in four hours. Small streams that are usually a few inches deep were transformed into raging torrents. Extensive flooding has swept away bridges, submerged roads and homes. While in some places the clean up has begun, Whaley Bridge has been evacuated in response to the partial collapse of Toddbrook Reservoir which overlooks it. If it bursts it would dump over a million tons of water onto the Derbyshire town that is home to more than 6,000 people. The water would then continue its rampage through villages along the River Goyt.
AUG5	In one fell swoop, Modi’s BJP has shut the door to a democratic, peaceful solution in Kashmir	The way the Indian government has approached its revocation of the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir shows it has given up on the concept that an administration’s legitimacy is derived from the consent of the governed. The cloak-and-dagger build-up to Monday’s shocking announcement – that after 70 years, Kashmir will no longer enjoy the additional rights and autonomy which were conditions of its original entry into the union of India – shows just how little trust remains between Delhi and Srinagar.
AUG5	Boris and Brexit have killed the union – it is now only a matter of time before Scotland is independent	He might be good at energising the moribund Conservative Party. He might, more fancifully, deliver a Brexit deal. Boris Johnson is, however, the worst possible choice as far as Scotland goes. The Tories could scarcely have come up with a more “English” prime minister if they’d tried. Styling himself, as he does, as “minister of the union” simply adds insult to injury. He sounds comically English. He is English (despite some cosmopolitan ancestry). And, more than anything, he is turning his party into an English National Party, whatever he says. “Do or die” Brexit means the most blatant disregard for the views of the Scottish people, who voted, lest we forget, to remain in the EU. They do not want to be railroaded out of it by a Westminster parliament run by a minority of English Conservative MPs, with a prime minister elected by 92,000 Tory party members, overwhelming, white, male, rich – and English.

AUG5	A diverse cabinet is great, but can Boris Johnson's team actually deliver policies which reflect our diversity?	Boris Johnson has brought together the most diverse cabinet in our political history, to match the most diverse parliament that has ever been elected, but the big question is whether his new top team can actually tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing our diverse communities. There have only previously been 12 bearers of the great offices of state – prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary – who have been a woman, or from an ethnic minority, in our history. Nine of them have been members forming part of Conservative cabinets.
AUG5	We’ve heard Trump’s empty platitudes about mass shootings before – nothing will change while he’s in power	Republican members of congress tweeted out “thoughts and prayers” on Sunday after the attacks in El Paso and Dayton over the weekend that left at least 30 dead, just like they have in the litany of previous mass shootings, knowing full well that America needs much more from their elected officials than that.  Others, including Donald Trump, have blamed the mass shootings on video games and mental illness. 
AUG5	As the world burns, Dominic Cummings, the British government’s arsonist, is fanning the flames	When it first emerged that Dominic Cummings was going to be made Boris Johnson’s chief of staff in 10 Downing Street, it didn’t take long for one particular choice quote to re-emerge. In an article earlier this year, Cummings said the European Research Group, of which around 80 Tory MPs are members, “should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic”.
AUG5	Boris Johnson’s no-deal bluster has put Leave voters’ livelihoods on the line	Jeremy Hunt (remember him?) infamously said he would go through with a no-deal Brexit even if it meant telling business owners their companies would go bust. Likewise and on a much bigger scale, our new leaders are clearly prepared to plunge Britain into recession as a trade-off for delivering Brexit by 31 October. New research suggests that, just like with Hunt, the sacrifice would not be theirs.  The last economic slump delivered the deepest cuts to the incomes of richer households. However, the next recession will hurt lower-income families the most, according to a report released on Monday by the Resolution Foundation. These, of course, are precisely the voters who chose Leave in the greatest numbers.
AUG5	Gun buybacks sound like a great idea to end the horror of US shootings – if only it were as simple as that	Americans own nearly half of the world’s guns, with approximately 120 firearms for every 100 US residents. Gun control policies may someday restrict new gun sales. But what impact can they have when Americans already own millions of guns?  Some have pointed to gun buybacks as a potential solution to this problem and in the wake of two distressing shootings in El Paso, Texas and in Dayton, Ohio, the issue is bound to be raised again.
AUG6	From India’s perspective, the conundrum of Kashmir has been resolved – but in reality, the worst is yet to come	In an apparent resolution of its Kashmir conundrum, India’s government has annulled Article 370 of its constitution, which offered a special status to the state since its accession to the country in 1947. The annulment delivers on a promise made by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the campaign during the recent elections, at which it was decisively re-elected.  Supporters claim the annulment will integrate the troubled state with India and eradicate the separatist tendencies that have plagued the region. Critics argue that the annulment threatens the very fabric of the constitution and reveals the BJP’s ingrained hostility to India’s federal structure. Far from resolving the Kashmir conundrum, revoking Kashmir’s special status will only deepen the region’s alienation from the rest of India, they argue.
AUG6	Of course McDonald's paper straws can't be recycled – it's yet another corporate green wash	Reduce, reuse, recycle. The three Rs: those words were drummed into our heads in primary school, we listened to the television ads singing those words to us. And yet, today, we’re still part of a throwaway society. Disposable items rule all – be it nappies, food containers or, the greatest con of all, bottled water. Businesses know that as consumers we want everything easy, simplified and often "to go", but they know we want to assuage our guilt too. We know we're behaving destructively and we want to feel better about it. That's why so many companies are caught "green washing", making misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product or service. 
AUG6	My time in prison made me fight for radical reform – and I’ve found some surprising allies along the way	Prisoners have been getting beaten by officers at one of Britain’s worst jails. You won’t see these beatings in the news, firstly because this stuff is commonplace; secondly because prisoners are largely voiceless and without proper recourse to justice; and, lastly, when one prisoner says "the officers did it!" and three officers say "rubbish, he fell down the stairs", well, there's no case is there, however black and blue they are beaten. So, in true reprobate fashion, we took the issue into our own hands. Fifteen people stood outside the prison and did a “noise demo” (which basically translates to making a racket). With a banner, a stick to beat the lamppost, and a megaphone, we communicated a message over that big old wall to let people know they're not alone.
AUG6	The Edinburgh Festival Fringe has never been a safe space for black performers, so I created my own	Like many artists in theatre, taking work to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe has always been a goal for me. In a city where everyone is looking out for new, young and exciting voices, it’s an amazing opportunity to showcase new work. Two years ago, however, my desire to go was challenged by an upsetting account of another black performer’s experience: Selina Thompson’s painful article “Excerpts from the diary of a black woman at the Edinburgh Fringe”, which articulated the isolation Thompson felt as a black artist in Edinburgh.  As a black writer and director myself, I couldn’t shake what I’d read from my mind: “I think of looking out into a white audience, and feeling horribly, horrifically alone, feeling like doing the show is going into battle,’’ Thompson wrote.

AUG6	The Tories are flinging us into a debt-laden Brexit calamity – the least they can do is give the people a Final Say	On 15 September 2008, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, it marked the beginning of the global financial crisis. Right now, we are hurtling towards a new calamity, entirely of our own making, and apparently unwilling to ask the people if they are happy to come along for the ride. In truth, the disaster that befell the world economy more than a decade ago was much more than a financial crisis. It was a social and political crisis – a landmark moment in the erosion of trust between citizens, authorities and experts in those countries most affected.
AUG6	Boris and Brexit have killed the union – it is now only a matter of time before Scotland is independent	He might be good at energising the moribund Conservative Party.

AUG6	Don’t let Boris Johnson's puppeteers fool you – parliament can still absolutely stop no-deal Brexit	Speculation about the UK leaving the European Union without a deal has been at fever pitch ever since Boris Johnson’s election as Tory leader and installation in No 10. Today, Downing Street said that the UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October “whatever the circumstances”. Pursuing a no-deal Brexit is clearly the goal, a wholly irresponsible political choice of the new administration for which there is no mandate.  More evidence has emerged of the challenge it poses for the economy. I have just managed to force the Treasury to disclose data which illustrates UK exporters to the EU are unprepared for a no-deal Brexit. 
AUG7	The Tories can’t discredit the allure of a Labour-SNP pact this time – Brexit has made Scottish independence far too attractive	As I interviewed Ed Miliband on his 2015 election battle bus, his exasperated aides frantically tried to persuade the BBC not to go big for a fourth day running on the prospect of a minority Labour government being propped up by the Scottish National Party. “How damaging is it?” the then Labour leader asked me. “Bad,” I replied. He wasn’t convinced. But the Tories’ repeated warnings of a “coalition of chaos” if Miliband became prime minister in a hung parliament undoubtedly damaged Labour’s prospects.
AUG7	The Boy Scouts scandal shows the sexual abuse of boys is a far bigger story than we’re willing to admit	I grew up Mormon in the US, and as a teenager I saw my male peers become part of Boy Scouts troops. I was jealous that they could play basketball, go on fishing trips and learn skills I thought would serve them better than the lessons on chastity, marriage and cooking that my female peers and I learned during our “Young Women” meetings. The boys looked like they were having so much fun. Sadly, I know now that what I observed on Tuesday evenings as I passed by our church gymnasium to my meeting room may not have been the full story.
AUG7	Isis may be gone but we are handing them a victory over the Yazidi people they tried to destroy	This week marks the five-year anniversary of the beginning of the genocide against the Yazidi – a religious minority – at the hands of Isis across Syria and Iraq. Most of the atrocities committed against the Yazidi people – especially its women and young girls – are too abhorrent and extensive to recount. While the genocide itself might have ceased, this is only the first part of the challenge; the consequences are bitter and painful in their own right. It was a horrific story of systematic sexual violence and coordinated military persecution. Jihadis marched thousands of men to slaughter before transporting thousands more women and children to Isis slave markets to be bartered and sold.
AUG7	Victoria’s Secret models are confronting it with the reality of sexual misconduct – let’s hope we’re a step closer to the company’s demise	 It hasn’t been a great year for Victoria’s Secret. And it’s only getting worse.
AUG7	Could Boris Johnson find an electoral high by legalising weed?	No one should be surprised if Boris Johnson were to announce a wish to legalise cannabis for recreational use.  Choosing to smoke would provide comfort to many in the event of a hard Brexit. Young voters might be seduced by an act of metropolitan liberalism. The outraged elderly who voted him in as leader comprise too small a group for him to worry about now.

AUG7	Fellow white people, Trump’s America is exactly ‘who we are’ – this is the same hateful nation we’ve always wrongly romanticised	“This is not who we are!” It’s a cry that reverberates around America with every Trump malfeasance, with his every flash of the white power symbol. It's the plaintive chorus of decent Americans: heartfelt, genuine and utterly deluded. America has always shown the world exactly “who we are”. The only ones who haven’t noticed are Americans themselves. Americans share a national ideology – the belief in their exceptionalism. It’s perhaps the only thing that unites the nation – the belief that America is the greatest country on earth, and that Americans are truly blessed, superior to all other beings. When vice president Mike Pence stood at a lectern addressing a room full of white people about America encamping on the Moon in five years’ time and said, “America doesn’t do second place”, he expressed a belief shared by most Americans: “We’re the best, and we know it.” Challenge this at your peril, for there is no greater impudence than to suggest America is anything but.
AUG7	A single cherry tomato can explain why Britain’s food future looks bleak with a no-deal Brexit	The dreams of Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman and the passionate will of Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl combined to make a reality of the European ideal and create a community of 28 nation states. It was to be the largest economic bloc on the planet, 500 million of us committed to an ever closer union built on peace and prosperity.  All very big and grand and very well, but I am much more impressed by the story of a Spanish cherry tomato. Let’s call him Tomas. Sadly, we may well be seeing a little less of Tomas as no-deal Brexit hurtles towards us with all its capacity for logistical destruction. 
AUG7	Toni Morrison's death couldn't come at a worse time – but her voice will still stir the fight against white supremacy	Given the eternal life of the written word, it would be odd to call this the end. But with the death of Toni Morrison, one of the most gifted and boundary-pushing contemporary writers we’ve had, it feels like the beginning of the end of something huge.  Though her wisdom will live on indefinitely, it seems painfully cruel to lose a figure like her now, in the wake of massacres and ideological attacks on increasingly vulnerable communities, and as we witness an almost laughable pivot to “calling out” white supremacy in name only. With social progress hanging by a thread, the timing of her departure is dreadful, as selfish as that sounds.  
AUG7	Beto O'Rourke has finally proved himself a worthy presidential candidate – don't drop out now	It may have taken tragedy but in the past few days Beto O’Rourke has finally gotten good at running for president.  There is a significant platform that comes with seeking the highest office in the US. Of all the candidates presently enjoying it, it is O’Rourke who has arguably made the best use of it in the wake of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso at the hands of a white nationalist. That is not to say that his Democratic colleagues have failed to respond meaningfully, but the manner in which O’Rourke conveyed the exasperation and anger at the greater forces that contribute to these violent incidents this week finally separated him from his competitors. 
AUG8	Liberals, some advice – your apocalyptic prophecies actually make Boris Johnson look pretty competent	I remember when Donald Trump first got elected there was an ill-fated Twitter campaign called #100DaysMax. It sounded like a bold product pledge for balding men, but was in fact a prediction he wouldn’t last more than 100 days in office. Because, as we all know, there’s nothing more politically powerful than a hashtag. If only we’d had them in the 1940s everything could’ve been sorted with a simple #GoAwayAdolf.
AUG8	The counter-terror chief wants help from sociologists. My findings? Britain must ditch its ruinous foreign policy	This week the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, spoke candidly about the ineffectiveness of existing policy, particularly the Government’s Prevent programme, the strand of counterterrorism that aims to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. Basu emphasised the need for counterterrorism to be underpinned by a broader policy agenda around “social inclusion” and called on sociologists and criminologist to help policy makers in identifying the underlying causes of terrorism. These are all welcome statements, perhaps suggesting some tentative steps in the right direction. However, what is really needed is not tinkering around the edges, but a radical policy shift. This will require along with it much greater recognition of how damaging the existing approach has been.
AUG8	Isis may be gone but we are handing them a victory over the Yazidi people they tried to destroy	This week marks the five-year anniversary of the beginning of the genocide against the Yazidi – a religious minority – at the hands of Isis across Syria and Iraq.

AUG8	Let’s call it by its name, Cyntoia Brown’s ‘sex work’ was child abuse pure and simple	When I first heard about the tragic case of Cyntoia Brown, sentenced in 2006 to 51 years for killing a man who was paying to use her for sex when she was 16-years-old, I immediately thought of Emma Humphreys. In 1985, Emma also killed a man in very similar circumstances. Both girls killed as a result of severe provocation and mental ill health, caused by the extreme abuse they had endured in prostitution. 
AUG8	Jade Goody was exploited by the media – and Britain’s hatred of ‘chavs’ meant it was somehow OK	Ten years since Jade Goody’s death, it’s easy to forget just how vilified the one-time “most hated woman in Britain” was by the same press that propelled her to stardom. A new three-part Channel 4 documentary, Goody: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain aims in part to force us to remember. The first instalment of the documentary, which aired last night, tracked Goody’s meteoric rise, from her childhood through to life after her first stint in Big Brother. In 2002, before we began to realise the immense damage that reality TV can have, Goody was cast in Big Brother aged just 20. She was a “real person”, a vulnerable, naive working class girl from a tough background in Bermondsey who would rope in viewers with her lack of filter. That’s what the producers thought, and it worked – almost overnight, Goody was ridiculed, not only for her perceived lack of intelligence but for her looks, too. “She totally delivered on what we thought she would, in a cold hard way. The viewers hated her,” says one producer during the documentary.
AUG8	Dominic Cummings, the latest self-appointed genius to run 10 Downing Street, is the most deluded of them all	Into the dawn light, the great man strode, ready to do great things. Dominic Cummings, vanguard and as yet sole member of the gilet noir movement, emerging into his new life, where the TV news cameras wait outside his house every morning. Cummings stomped up his own exterior steps as if they were the establishment he is about to crush. Well, some of the establishment, anyway. Not all the establishment. Not, say, his father-in-law, the baronet Sir Humphry Wakefield, nor any of the extended family, including, to take a randomised sample, the 1st Viscount De L’Isle, the 1st Baron Howick of Glendale or the 5th Earl Grey, from whom the family pile, Chillingham Castle, was acquired. The castle is also, we understand, fine for now.
AUG8	To make Brexit happen, Boris needs to work with the Eurocrats he’s insulted. Fat chance they’ll help him now	As our prime minister and the no-deal zealots of his cabinet revel in Brexit brinkmanship it is worth recalling the legal realities of what threatens to be our post Halloween world. Not long ago, an embarrassed Boris Johnson was called out for his apparent reliance on Article 24 of the WTO rules which could govern parts of UK trade should we crash out of the EU on 31 October. His mistake was to brush aside the requirement that the EU is a willing partner in the arrangements that follow. Now, though, weeks of anti-EU bluster and rhetoric have alienated the very people the prime minister would need to happily gather round the table.
AUG9	Economists are united by one thing in the wake of the troubling GDP figures: Brexit will make them worse	Taken by itself, a 0.2 per cent contraction of UK GDP between April and June would not be a major concern. But the alarm bells should be ringing with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) alerting about a “slowing in the underlying figures” combined with concerns about the government’s economic policy. GDP is a useful economic indicator but GDP per worker is better as it is a measure of productivity. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist observed: “Productivity isn’t everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.”
AUG9	Boris Johnson's plan to boost British science is a puny water pistol against the raging flames of Brexit	Boris Johnson has made his long-overdue pitch to the world of science, and it is a lightweight, barely formed beast which counterbalances the onrushing Brexit damage much like a toy plastic duck in the bath counterbalances a collapsing house. Yesterday afternoon, Boris Johnson scheduled a video on his Facebook page, ostensibly announcing science immigration plans. In fact, the two-minute live video spent the first minute on police and the NHS, before spending one minute proclaiming there would be changes to immigration rules to make the UK even more open to scientists – and now he had to go back to work. It was fleeting, at best.
AUG9	The counter-terror chief wants help from sociologists. My findings? Britain must ditch its ruinous foreign policy	This week the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, spoke candidly about the ineffectiveness of existing policy, particularly the Government’s Prevent programme, the strand of counterterrorism that aims to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. Basu emphasised the need for counterterrorism to be underpinned by a broader policy agenda around “social inclusion” and called on sociologists and criminologist to help policy makers in identifying the underlying causes of terrorism. These are all welcome statements, perhaps suggesting some tentative steps in the right direction. However, what is really needed is not tinkering around the edges, but a radical policy shift. This will require along with it much greater recognition of how damaging the existing approach has been.
AUG9	Isis may be gone but we are handing them a victory over the Yazidi people they tried to destroy	This week marks the five-year anniversary of the beginning of the genocide against the Yazidi – a religious minority – at the hands of Isis across Syria and Iraq. Most of the atrocities committed against the Yazidi people – especially its women and young girls – are too abhorrent and extensive to recount. While the genocide itself might have ceased, this is only the first part of the challenge; the consequences are bitter and painful in their own right. It was a horrific story of systematic sexual violence and coordinated military persecution. Jihadis marched thousands of men to slaughter before transporting thousands more women and children to Isis slave markets to be bartered and sold.
AUG9	Could Boris Johnson find an electoral high by legalising weed?	No one should be surprised if Boris Johnson were to announce a wish to legalise cannabis for recreational use.  Choosing to smoke would provide comfort to many in the event of a hard Brexit. Young voters might be seduced by an act of metropolitan liberalism. The outraged elderly who voted him in as leader comprise too small a group for him to worry about now. 
AUG9	Victoria’s Secret models are confronting it with the reality of sexual misconduct – let’s hope we’re a step closer to the company’s demise	 It hasn’t been a great year for Victoria’s Secret. And it’s only getting worse.
AUG9	The scorched corpses of Nagasaki should be a grim restraint to the chest beating in India, America and Iran	We like our anniversaries in blocks of 50 or 100 – at a push we’ll tolerate a 25. The 100th anniversary of the Somme (2016), the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain (2015). Next year, we’ll remember the end of the Second World War, the first – and so far the only – nuclear war in history. This week marks only the 74th anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It doesn’t fit in to our journalistic scorecards and “timelines”. Over the past few days, I’ve had to look hard to find a headline about the two Japanese cities.
AUG9	Modi’s act of tyranny in Kashmir will soon be the blueprint for all of India	The Hindu-supremacist government of India, headed by Narendra Modi, has just carried out a coup of India’s constitution and with Kashmir’s autonomy. Jammu and Kashmir has been “put in its place”: stripped not only of its nominal autonomy but even of its status as a state of the Indian union, and summarily demoted to a “union territory” administered by the central government. In preparation for this stealthy move, 35,000 troops were flown to Kashmir Valley, which was already one of the most militarised regions of the world. Following the government’s announcement, 8,000 more paramilitary troops have been deployed to the same region.    
AUG9	Our Islamophobia definition is no backdoor blasphemy law – the government must stop dawdling and take it on board	When the Labour Party rejected, and attempted to redefine, the IHRA definition of antisemitism, it was not only patronising and lacking in self-awareness, but also sent out an awful message that the Labour party was not ready to listen or trust British Jews with defining their experiences of antisemitism.   If we simply change the words Labour to Conservative, IHRA definition of antisemitism to APPG on British Muslims definition of Islamophobia and British Jews to British Muslims, it feels like we are experiencing groundhog day.
AUG9	Trump’s conflict with China is a real war – both will shed blood for control of capitalism’s monstrous machine	The trade war between the US and China can only fill us with dread. How will it affect our daily lives? Will it result in a new global recession or even geopolitical chaos? To orient ourselves in this mess, we should bear in mind some basic facts. The trade conflict with China is just the culmination of a war which began years ago when Donald Trump fired the opening shot aimed at the biggest trading partners of the US by deciding to levy tariffs on the imports of steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico.
AUG10	Boris Johnson’s drive towards a no-deal Brexit is no bluff – he really believes in it now	Normally, Downing Street is half-empty in August, due to the holiday season and parliament being in recess. This year, No 10 is buzzing  with activity; this week, I was surprised to see every desk occupied. Political advisers have been banned from taking holidays until 31 October. Boris Johnson has written to all civil servants, urging them to prepare “urgently and rapidly” for exit day as their top priority. Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, has disclosed that a support fund will prop up companies hit by a no-deal exit.
AUG10	I warned that adopting the IHRA would shut down Palestinian protest – I’ve been proved right	When cyclists signed up for this year’s Big Ride For Palestine, which raises funds for a charity aiding Palestinian children in Gaza, they were expecting to finish with a rally in a Tower Hamlets park. But the council took a secret decision to ban the rally using a false interpretation of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) controversial “working definition” of antisemitism. Internal mails, acquired by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign after submission of a freedom of information request, revealed that officials, influenced by the furore over antisemitism in the Labour Party, were concerned that references to “apartheid” and “ethnic cleansing” on the Big Ride’s website were antisemitic, according to the definition.

AUG10	On the anniversary of Nagasaki, it is time to stop pretending we would ever use these weapons again	On 6 and 9 August 1945 two atomic bombs killed 120,000-250,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Now, 74 years on, the world still has thousands of even more powerful versions of these weapons of mass destruction. Britain should lead the way by getting rid of its nuclear arsenal.

AUG10	Matteo Salvini is going for broke – but this is why his push for an election could easily backfire	The decision by Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League, to withdraw his confidence in the coalition government his party makes up with the Five Star Movement and demand immediate elections, has abruptly ended Italy’s brief experiment in “populist coalition” government.  Despite protestations to the contrary, the move is in line with Salvini’s strategic goal of transforming the League from a previously northern “separatist” movement into a right-wing, “sovranista” (reclaiming national sovereignty) party which has the electoral strength to lead both a far-right government and a European network of like-minded parties.

AUG10	Brooke Houts’ animal abuse breaks the ‘perfect’ YouTuber illusion – yet our kids are still fooled	As a parent in the summer holidays, there are certain activities that you’ll let your children do for nine hours straight without feeling compelled to intervene, and others that you simply won’t. Reading books? How edifying! Making art? Very creative! Swingball? An unmistakable cry for help, but at least they’ll be getting their vitamin D. Mixed feelings. On the flipside, television is a big no-no almost irrespective of what they’re watching. “It’s rotting your brain!”, you’ll cry instinctively, as they reluctantly drag themselves away from a five-part BBC4 series on the history of ceramics. And as technology embeds itself ever further into our homes, computers and smartphones have inherited the TV’s traditional aura of mindlessness.
AUG11	Jeffrey Epstein’s death won’t stop the truth from coming out – his accusers deserve to be heard	How did the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein get away with it? The clue is in the question of course. He was operating in plain sight, in fact. If the allegations are correct, he was not hanging around school gates in a van waiting for his prey. No, he employed and presumably paid people to do it – every one of them witnesses if not accomplices in his activities. He had staff, assistants, associates who would travel the globe looking for young girls – procuring them, as the chilling phrase goes. This was done on an industrial scale – hundreds of them it is alleged, aged about 14 to 17 or so. It was hardly a secret to them. A few have come forward including one, Jennifer Araoz who says Epstein raped her when she was 15 years old, a horrific accusation. She says she was groomed by an adult female who approached her outside her New York high school. 
AUG11	Could Boris Johnson really force through no-deal? As a constitutional lawyer, here’s how the situation may play out	The temperature has been rising over Brexit. Dominic Cummings, the UK prime minister’s special adviser, has indicated that even if the government loses an autumn confidence vote and must ultimately call a general election, the PM may simply decide that polling day takes place after October 31. Since polling day is normally held on a Thursday, possible dates would include November 7 or 14. That would mean that Brexit would be delivered during a general election campaign, when parliament is not sitting. It could, of course, also mean that the UK would leave the EU without a deal while parliament isn’t sitting – even though MPs have repeatedly expressed their opposition to such a scenario. As a matter of law, delaying polling day is permissible. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 simply states that polling day is set by the Queen on “the recommendation of the prime minister”. The exact timing is left open. The absence of any restriction is a striking statutory oversight. Perhaps the drafters never contemplated that a government on the losing side of a confidence vote would drag its heels over calling an election. Such political masochism would surely be penalised once polling day finally arrived. In fact, Brexit is reversing the incentive structure. Heel-dragging is suddenly advantageous for a government looking to avoid further wrangling with MPs.

AUG11	Doing the hajj more than once isn’t obligatory, but here’s why I keep going back anyway	I have been lucky enough to have gone on hajj three times, most recently in 2018. This hajj was something my wife and I had planned since 2006, but for some reason or another it had taken 12 years for the two of us to go together.  It is an overwhelming experience, filled with lots of apprehension and a great sense of personal fulfilment.
AUG11	No, sharing political donations data is not McCarthyism – stop being ridiculous	Earlier this week, it was revealed that Stephen Ross, the billionaire businessman behind brands such as Equinox and SoulCycle, would host a fundraiser for Donald Trump on Friday 9 August at his home in Southampton. At that time, Ross’s name might not have been particularly recognisable, but the ventures funded by his fortune certainly were.  Equinox and SoulCycle in particular (which represent a relatively tiny part of Ross’s business catalogue) stuck out, perhaps because they embody a particular type of ethos – the big-city, liberal-voting, college-educated elites that believe capitalism is the devil but will spend £28 on a spin class in the name of self-care – and seem completely at odds with the president’s base. It doesn’t help that both Equinox and SoulCycle have made a point of celebrating Pride, when the Trump administration has attacked LGBT+ rights on many occasions.

AUG12	One conspiracy theory about Jeffrey Epstein's death is real, and it's been right under our noses all along	Early Saturday morning, news broke that high-profile financier and alleged sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had died, apparently by suicide, in his cell at the federal jail in downtown Manhattan. The facility, called the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), holds about 800 people awaiting trial on federal charges. Within hours, the internet was awash in conspiracy theories about his death. In 2018, I published an investigation into conditions at the MCC on the New York City-based outlet Gothamist, and this weekend, as that story began to circulate on Twitter, the conspiracy theorists also found their way onto my timeline. “Epstein was running a classic ‘Honey Trap’” for Western Intel,” one person tweeted at me. “If you have no understanding of the Deep State tactics, you believe what you see on TV. Keep believing baby. That’s what they are counting on.”
AUG12	Jeffrey Epstein's death will probably be good for his accusers – and Trump knows it	The reaction to the death of Jeffrey Epstein has not been one of heartbreak. Indeed, many would say that the tragedy of his death by apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Manhattan is not his, but his victims', who will now never see him stand trial for the full extent of his crimes. The immediate – and near-universal – reaction to Epstein’s death has been disbelief that a defendant as high-profile as Epstein could be able to seemingly take his own life in prison, less than three weeks after an apparent suicide attempt. That disbelief has crystallised into something almost paranoid.
AUG12	My article about my Trump-loving in-laws went viral – then I got a rude awakening from the right-wing media	Last week, I published a personal essay about my septuagenarian in-laws, who, in the wake of two years of American political unrest, have experienced somewhat of a political awakening. The piece was titled “It might be time to cut my right-wing, Trump-loving in-laws out of my kids’ lives”, and it almost instantly went viral.
AUG12	Sajid Javid’s no-deal 50p coins aren’t just a waste of money, they’ll have even less value if we have a no-deal Brexit	The government’s latest wheeze to convince us that Brexit means Brexit was announced this weekend. Sajid Javid is drawing up plans for millions of 50p coins to be issued when the UK leaves the EU later this year. One side of the coins will feature the words “peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”.
AUG12	Worrying about ageing as a young millennial woman isn’t as silly as you think	At the age of 26, I find myself looking in the mirror a lot, appraising myself in different lightings and at various angles. I do not feel beautiful, or even pretty, but I feel very strongly that I am in my prime, though possibly a little past my peak.  My skin is supple and dewy. My breasts are full. I find myself thinking things like: I am sumptuously young. Languorously female. I never think this in a purring, indulgent sort of way, gazing at myself, pouting. Rather, I reflect on myself with the air of a woman in a Francine Van Hove painting: a woman in waiting, though not sure what for. I am wistful and wonder how much longer I have left before it all goes irrevocably to pot. 
AUG12	On the anniversary of Nagasaki, it is time to stop pretending we would ever use these weapons again	On 6 and 9 August 1945 two atomic bombs killed 120,000-250,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Now, 74 years on, the world still has thousands of even more powerful versions of these weapons of mass destruction. Britain should lead the way by getting rid of its nuclear arsenal. 
AUG12	British democracy has been hollowed out by neoliberalism – and Brexit will make it a whole lot worse	The Leave campaign slogan “Take Back Control” turns out to mean control by Boris Johnson and the majority of the 160,000 members of the Conservative Party who elected him. He is threatening to prorogue parliament and crash out of the European Union despite widespread opposition and despite everything we know about the dangerous economic and social consequences and the years of negotiations and political polarisation that will follow. On his watch, Brexit will never be over. If Labour is to develop an effective opposition to Johnson and his ilk, it needs to reclaim the slogan “take back control” and show that the message can only be achieved in actuality through a strategy of remaining inside the EU and transforming democracy in both Britain and Europe. The Brexit vote, at least in areas hardest hit by the decline of manufacturing and mining in the south as well as the north, was a howl of protest about not being heard in either Westminster or Brussels.
AUG12	Caroline Lucas’s all-women cabinet is a terrible idea that makes me despair for the campaign to stop no-deal Brexit	Say what you like about Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove, but – all men – they do possess a certain ruthless quality, or at least they give a good impression of it, which is just as good. Misguided, yes, but they have a clear policy goal, “do or die” Brexit on 31 October. Everyone knows it. Everyone understands it. Most of us think it is nuts. But no-one can call them fuzzy. The gang also has a political strategy – deliver Brexit, first; do some other populist stuff; defeat Corbyn at a general election – and spend now, pay later for the police and the schools. They have the advantages of incumbency. They can command the media by launching real initiatives with real consequences, not just make speeches.

AUG13	Hong Kong protests: Why Chinese media has been focusing on Britain's colonial past	Over recent weeks, mass protests against proposed changes to extradition law in Hong Kong have escalated into a major crisis. In the latest round of protests, tens of thousands took the streets. In the West, the media has reported this as a struggle for basic rights and freedoms. In China, coverage has been limited as the protests are perceived to be negative. But in what restricted reporting that there has been, the perspective is very different from the West, and reflects deep-seated Chinese views about colonial interference in Hong Kong.
AUG13	How many Americans does it take to defeat the NRA's stranglehold? Democrats might have just found the answer	Since 2016, elected officials and public intellectuals have attempted to search for cultural common ground in these hyper-partisan Trumpian times. Though it seems that the shared American cultural experience is no longer music, or cinema, or even faith in Western democracy – it’s coping with the reality of mass gun violence. The 31 victims of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton bring us one step closer to the dark day when every single American has either been directly involved in a mass shooting or personally knows someone involved in a mass shooting.
AUG13	My Jewish faith means I need to protest against Donald Trump's ICE. I don't regret being arrested	This summer, the way I understand the meaning of my identity as an American Jewish college student has changed.  In the wake of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdowns, being a young American Jew now means that I watch my friends place their bodies on the line outside US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, obstructing passage and risking arrest.
AUG13	Joe Biden had a chance to talk about guns in good faith. He failed miserably	The horror of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton have led to calls for more gun control legislation. And while most of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have mentioned such legislation in passing up into this point, former vice president Joe Biden has upped the ante with an op-ed in the New York Times. In it, Biden calls for reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. Biden makes a passionate case, but unfortunately, what he writes doesn't rely much on facts and evidence. If there are to be substantive discussions about gun control, those who support it must do so from a position of good faith. Many do not, and neither does Biden. He writes, "We have a huge problem with guns. Assault weapons — military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly — are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such."

AUG13	The Top 10: More Twitter Jokes	As is traditional at this time of year, I leave you in the hands of some of Twitter’s finest. Many of these, as is also traditional, are by Moose Allain, who is brilliant. Follow him on Twitter. Buy his stuff. Read his books.  1. People laughed when I said I wanted to be a professional snooker player. They’re not laughing now because it was ages ago. Liz Buckley. 
AUG13	What the case of Jeffrey Epstein tells us about America's sickening worship of billionaire gods	At the time of his arrest, Jeffrey Epstein was said to have been worth nearly $2 billion. Epstein, a convicted paedophile who for years was known in elite circles as a funder and philanthropic figure, had ties to many other wealthy white men including former president Clinton, and current president Donald Trump — two men who have been accused of sexual predatory behavior themselves.   Interestingly enough, the source of Epstein’s incredible wealth is a mystery. No one knows exactly where or how he became so rich, and anyone old enough to remember the Bernie Madoff scheme should realize that that’s a problem. Regardless of whether Epstein procured his money through nefarious means or not, what is true is that in America, that’s always fine until you’re caught.
AUG13	With his new immigration policy, Trump has found an official way to 'send them back'	President Trump has unveiled his latest immigration policy. In a move that should leave little doubt as to the core mission of his administration’s immigration reform campaign, he is attempting make it easier to deny people visas for being poor.  Announced yesterday, Trump's latest policy enables a new aspect to the review process for green card and citizenship applications: essentially implementing a system where applicants would be “sized up” based on their wealth and financial resources, health, education and English-language proficiency. Specifically, it dictates that evaluators should consider whether an applicant has used government assistance programs. This will target and punish legal immigrants who use safety net programs like SNAP, Medicaid, or government-subsidized housing.
AUG13	Boris Johnson thinks building more prisons can curtail violence – he couldn’t be any more wrong	Once again the nation’s politicians have ramped up the law and order rhetoric. For anyone even vaguely paying attention this will all feel very familiar. In 1993, prime minister John Major urged us to “condemn a little more and understand a little less” when considering the response to violent crime. New Labour’s response was to one-up the Tories with a “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” approach, introducing an array of new police and court powers to ensure even low-level offenders could be put away for years.
AUG13	I met Jeffrey Epstein and he admitted he knew the secrets of the rich and the powerful	Almost exactly a year ago, on 16 August 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion. The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.
AUG14	You don't have to respect Anthony Scaramucci to know that what he's saying is important	Like many people who regularly exercise their gift of discernment, I have a hard time taking anything that flows from Anthony Scararmucci’s mouth seriously.  During an appearance on HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher last Friday, Scaramucci said that he stood by President Trump despite his flaws because he loves his country. (In related news, 1 + 1 = 702.) By Sunday, Scaramucci was calling for a new candidate to top the 2020 Republican ticket in an interview with Axios. He claimed if Trump “doesn’t reform his behaviour, it will not just be me, but many others will be considering helping to find a replacement in 2020.”
AUG14	How the Hong Kong protestors rebounded from a night of violence to rediscover their secret weapon	Between the check-in aisles of Hong Kong International Airport last night, a maelstrom of masked young men in black swirled around the limp, pinioned figure of an accused enemy mole. Many in the crowd pushed their way to the centre to strike him or bellow obscenities that seemed to make the vast terminal building shudder. Paramedics tried to move him to safety but were stopped by the crush of angry protestors.  It was a scene that made many in the city wonder: how did we get here? This was the movement made world famous by its almost absurd levels of civility: from uniformed students doing their homework on occupied streets to armoured frontliners collecting recycling and tidying the streets where they had just locked horns with riot police. 
AUG14	The Advertising Standards Authority said it would ban gender stereotypes – so why are we seeing ads like these?	At best it’s boring and lazy. At worst, it’s representative of something far more concerning: that some in TV advertising still struggle with the revolutionary idea that women work and men can be primary caregivers. Earlier this week, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints concerning gender stereotyping in two commercials, from Mondelez and Volkswagen respectively.
AUG14	Hong Kong protests: Why Chinese media has been focusing on Britain's colonial past	Over recent weeks, mass protests against proposed changes to extradition law in Hong Kong have escalated into a major crisis. In the latest round of protests, tens of thousands took the streets. In the West, the media has reported this as a struggle for basic rights and freedoms. In China, coverage has been limited as the protests are perceived to be negative. But in what restricted reporting that there has been, the perspective is very different from the West, and reflects deep-seated Chinese views about colonial interference in Hong Kong.
AUG14	Uganda wins new investment for tourism	By Sarah Mawerere for UBC Radio in Uganda  Bringing new conservation-compatible businesses to invest in Uganda’s protected areas brings new funding to help pay for their upkeep and protecting their wildlife. 
AUG14	Only 11 per cent of TV viewers can name 15 female actors over 40 – because they never see them	In May 2018, after watching yet another drama premiere featuring a man in middle age in the leading role paired with a much younger partner, I started to look for the women my own age leading the shows we all watch. I found many new shows featuring middle-aged men – This Time with Alan Partridge, Don’t Forget the Driver, Home, After Life and Semi-Detached – and returning shows with leading males such as Not Going Out and Car Share, I only found two shows led by women: Mum and Sally4Ever. 
AUG14	I have a plan to defeat Dominic Cummings and Brexit in nine steps	Dominic Cummings is hell-bent on quitting the EU on 31 October. He’ll try to persuade his boss, Boris Johnson, to do whatever it takes – even if this means flouting the constitutional convention that prime ministers must resign if they lose a vote of no confidence and a rival can win a vote of confidence. Pro-Europeans inside and outside parliament must foil Cummings’ devilish plot. So I have devised a nine-point plan that should do the trick. There can’t be a snap election unless either two thirds of MPs support one or Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence in Johnson and wins. Either way, there can’t be an election without the Labour leader’s approval. So he shouldn’t go for one until and unless the conditions are ripe.
AUG14	Dear Hong Kong protestors: you have the support of Chairman Mao	Step back for one moment from the frenzied scenes of tear gas in underground railway stations and armoured personnel carriers massing on the border and there’s a grotesque historical irony which helps reveal the future for Hong Kong.  In China, the notion represents heresy but recent evidence suggests that protestors have more in common with Chairman Mao Zedong and the early ideology for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) than the Chinese government does.
AUG14	If Priti Patel backs this unfair minimum salary threshold for migrants, people like me won’t stand a chance	A few days ago, EU nationals in the UK were dealt another blow as Iain Duncan Smith, co-founder of the Centre for Social Justice, urged Priti Patel, the home secretary, to raise the minimum salary threshold for immigrants from £30,000 to £36,700 per year. As an EU national from Sweden who has lived and worked in the UK for nine years, I am outraged. But first, let’s consider how this new proposal, if approved, will cripple several industries in the country that rely on an EU workforce, such as the NHS and the hospitality industry.
AUG14	Corporations are refusing to abandon intrusive facial recognition in public – so let’s beat the system instead	One of the most sinister but ignored elements of parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee inquiry into fake news was the use of machine learning to process the images of people by Canadian firm AggregateIQ. This software could be used to scan photographs of people and potentially match them to their Facebook profile. Across the internet, it is possible right now that your face is being used to match you across different platforms in different situations to build a picture of who you are. Our faces give away a lot about us; our ethnicity, our gender, our age, our weight, and more importantly can be cross-referenced quickly using our social media profiles to discover who we are. Your social media profile is then a gateway to your likes, your mood and your location.  This is why we should be so concerned about the use of facial recognition technology by private developer Argent in their 67-acre development in the heart of King’s Cross. It isn’t clear why Argent requires such controversial technology at all, but right now in central London, tens of thousands of unsuspecting citizens are having their faces scanned by a property developer. 
AUG15	Of course we're angry at Steve King – but we should also be thanking him	From the president’s racist attacks against Baltimore, to Melania’s “I don’t really care, do u” jacket, one of the hallmarks of Trumpism is an expression of the vilest nature of the Republican party’s anti-immigrant, misogynistic ideology. In fact, Trump taking office marked the beginning of a period of Republicans “saying the quiet part loud”. Trump is, of course, the king of this genre, but Steve King is quickly making a name for himself as the guy who says the crazy stuff that a lot of Republicans have long believed, but have been smart enough to never say out loud. 
AUG15	If Chinese tanks take Hong Kong, who'll be surprised? Land grabs are happening everywhere – and we're all complicit	In the glorious world of journalism, tanks always “roll” across borders. I’ve never in my life actually seen a tank roll, but you get the point. They don’t let anything stand in their way – or nothing is supposed to stand in their way. Hence the Hong Kong Chinese should back off if the People’s Army come “rolling” across the border; the Syrian Kurds should stand aside if the Turkish army crosses their mutual border; the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir must pay respect to the Indian army’s reinforcements; the Ukrainians or Russians hostile to Putin should not tangle with the Russian army on the Black Sea coast. Nor should the Palestinians protest when Israel’s army arrives to demolish their homes or steal more of their land.
AUG15	Citizens Advice’s racist training on Bame communities confirmed what I always knew about UK organisations	“We live in a multicultural society, and racism does not exist anymore”. This is one of the several messages I received after I was invited to speak on BBC Woman’s Hour recently about how we should talk with our children about race from a very young age. While I received many messages of support for bringing this very important conversation into the mainstream media, I also received some messages telling me that by talking about racism, I am making the problem worse. “Everyone just gets on,” one person tweeted. The very next day, I saw a slide as part of the training by Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) titled “Barriers we find in Bame communities”. This shocked me to the core. Besides the very generalised acronym “Bame” that homogenises a broad and diverse range of people and communities, and use of language that immediately creates a feeling of “them” and “us”, this training document is filled with shocking stereotypes. Let us unravel a couple of them here. 
AUG15	Be honest, do you actually care about the record number of drug-related deaths?	Repeating the same illogical behaviour over and over again may seem absurd, especially when we think of people using illicit drugs like heroin and crack cocaine. But as another record for drug-related deaths is set, 4,327 in the past year alone, it seems the political response to this tragedy is equally irrational.  The increase in drug-related deaths hasn’t suddenly happened, deaths have been rising significantly for years. There has been ample opportunity to think about how to reverse this horrendous trend. And unusually, we know how to do it. The evidence has been collected and made available to ministers. 
AUG15	We know Stacey Abrams is serious about changing America because she's not running for president	Stacey Abrams has announced that she will not seek the Democratic party nomination for president in 2020. Following months of speculation, the Georgia Democrat – who narrowly lost out in 2018’s gubernatorial race to Republican Brian Kemp – teased a “special announcement” on social media. And it turned out it wasn’t a presidential one. Instead, Abrams said that she would be lending her platform to Fair Fight 2020, a new initiative that aims to end voter suppression. As was proven in the 2018 mid-terms, when Abrams lost out to her Trump-backing Republican counterpart, voter suppression works. Brian Kemp was supposed to be in charge of making sure the election he stood in was fair; he ended up facing lawsuits forremoving more than 100,000 people from the electoral register after they didn’t vote in previous elections. His office has failed to approve 53,000 registrations primarily from black Americans.

AUG15	I'll never use the term 'Moscow Mitch' – and you shouldn't either	As a leftist millennial I’d normally be the first person to take a Twitter dunk on an odious Republican politician. But when #MoscowMitch went viral, I didn’t want anything to do with it. For those who don’t spend most of their days on social media, “Moscow Mitch” is a label coined in response to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s intransigence on passing election security legislation in response to concerns of Russian meddling. It started out as a Twitter hashtag, but has now become ubiquitous, being deployed by protesters in Kentucky as well as by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself.
AUG15	Why has Europe abandoned Uganda and its 2 million refugees?	Germany and the UK have suspended refugee funding to Uganda, the world’s second-biggest host country for refugees. The almost 2 million displaced people in Uganda will be the victims of this, driving them into the hands of ruthless people traffickers – and perhaps to the shores of Europe. Uganda is a humanitarian superpower that is almost completely unrecognised as such outside humanitarian and aid circles. Second only to Turkey in the number of refugees within its borders, Uganda is special not only because of the numbers it welcomes, but because of the way it treats them.
AUG15	The cruel reaction to Greta Thunberg isn’t just because she’s a young woman – it’s because she has Asperger's	Like young people the world over, I was delighted to hear that Greta Thunberg, the youth climate activist, has set sail for New York on a zero-carbon boat. The 16-year-old is making her way across the Atlantic with plans to travel through the US, Canada and Mexico, culminating in an appearance at the annual UN climate change conference in Chile in December. And though I was shocked at the extent of the vitriol levelled at her as she started her voyage, I was not surprised to see her under attack.
AUG15	Ken Cuccinelli's Statue of Liberty remarks prove that the American Dream is only open to white people	 The Trump administration has spent little time hiding what it thinks of people of colour in the US and across the world. Remember when the president reportedly referred to the homelands of those coming from Africa and Latin America as “shithole countries”? Or when he kicked off his campaign by describing Mexicans as rapists and criminals?
AUG16	If Israel wants to ban antisemites, it should start by banning antisemites	I’m no stranger to trumped-up antisemitism charges placed on Muslims. As a Jewish refugee from Soviet-dominated Uzbekistan, we lived as a minority among majority Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs and other Muslims for generations. Of course, no melting pot is free from conflict, but under Soviet dominance, which disguised white supremacy as communism, our families were in it together. At home in Queens, New York, we were the first of our family and among the first Bukharian Jews to settle in the US as HIAS refugees. With our success came opportunities to receive other families fleeing as hosts. My childhood became a reality show, where each season, a new family would arrive and its elders and its children would share with me all of their stories. They arrived in Muslim or Jewish garb from Iran, Mongolia, China, North Africa and Eastern Europe, with the same instruments and traditions we recognised. And the stories they told made two things very clear to me.
AUG16	What Jay Z's deal with the NFL made me realize about black capitalism	This week, the NFL announced  a multi-year deal with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation. This deal allows Roc Nation control of the NFL’s music and social justice programs. And yes, that’s the same NFL that Jay-Z mentioned in “Apeshit”, his joint song with wife Beyonce, when he sang: “I said no to the Super Bowl, you don’t need me, I don’t need you.” Those lyrics, at the time so seemingly revolutionary in their claims that a black music mogul didn’t need an institution as huge as the NFL to elevate his worth by association, now ring rather hollow. It’s not lyrical hypocrisy that has most people upset about the deal, though. Instead, it’s the fact that former NFL star Colin Kaepernick was blackballed after protesting the deaths of black Americans killed by the police. How can hip-hop’s first billionaire justifiably work with an organisation which destroyed the career of a racial justice activist?
AUG16	Democrats are psychologically different to Republicans. That's why Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang don't stand a chance	In 2015, a year before the US electoral system was primed to send the White House its first new occupant in eight years, Donald Trump engineered an astonishing takeover of the Republican Party. It’s 2019 now, and once again America finds itself a year away from a massive presidential election — except this time, there is zero chance the party out of office trusts an outsider with the reins. To understand why that is, we need to rehash how Trump was able to hijack an entire party and bend it to his will.
AUG16	Uganda uses innovative methods to deal with human-elephant conflict	By Suhail Mugabi for NTV Green in Uganda  A year after he spent a week investigating human-elephant conflict in Uganda, Suhail Mugabi returned to Queen Elizabeth National Park to see a new fence designed to end the scourge. 
AUG16	Tracking lions in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park	By Ronald Musoke for The Independent in Uganda  Lions are a must-see in Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda and yet their reclusive nature sometimes makes it a frustrating experience for visitors. On a recent conservation study tour to the park, almost everyone in my group admitted to never having seen a lion in the wild.
AUG16	At the Iowa State Fair, 2020 Democrats tried to seem relatable. It was fun to watch	After his speech at the Iowa State Fair this past weekend, presidential candidate Tim Ryan really wanted to make sure that everyone knew he drinks beer. Stepping up to a podium under a big white Des Moines Register canopy to shield the candidates from the beating sun, the Ohio congressman was drenched in sweat, and taking swigs from a water bottle.
AUG16	I'm a Trump voter – but I'm scared by his latest mass surveillance plans	Mass Surveillance of a population is typically discussed only in frightening movies or when referring to communist China. But the truth is that mass surveillance exists in many western nations, just not as openly.  America’s surveillance method is different from the UK’s, and is less well known. Reporting for VICE in 2018, Nafeez Ahmed exposed efforts by the Pentagon to "monitor social media to pre-empt major anti-government protests in the US." What's frightening is that the Pentagon was specifically targeting protests critical to president Donald Trump. According to Ahmed, this was "part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to consolidate the US military's role and influence on domestic intelligence." 
AUG16	I helped to launch Change UK – the fiasco that followed holds powerful lessons for Remainers	This week marks six months since I made my way to London’s County Hall to listen to seven MPs announce that they had quit the Labour Party and were forming the Independent Group.  We all know what happened next. What began with such promise has ended in splits and acrimony.
AUG16	Of course we're angry at Steve King – but we should also be thanking him	From the president’s racist attacks against Baltimore, to Melania’s “I don’t really care, do u” jacket, one of the hallmarks of Trumpism is an expression of the vilest nature of the Republican party’s anti-immigrant, misogynistic ideology. In fact, Trump taking office marked the beginning of a period of Republicans “saying the quiet part loud”. Trump is, of course, the king of this genre, but Steve King is quickly making a name for himself as the guy who says the crazy stuff that a lot of Republicans have long believed, but have been smart enough to never say out loud. 
AUG16	More than 200 children have died in Idlib since April yet we are forgetting about the Syrian conflict	The other day I saw a report of an airstrike hitting a medical facility in Idlib, killing a paramedic and an ambulance driver. Not a legitimate military target, but a medical facility. Then, shortly after, an airstrike hit again. Charles Lister from the Middle East Institute described it as a “double tap … designed specifically to target rescue workers”. Then I checked the news for the outrage. There was none. Then I checked social media for the outrage. None there either. We have just commissioned a YouGov poll which found that nearly one in four people in the UK didn’t know that the Syrian conflict was still happening or they thought it had ended. This apathy towards the conflict is a tragedy, because we need the world’s attention and scrutiny on Syria now as much as ever.
AUG17	Summer holiday attractions for kids are ridiculously extortionate – no wonder low-income families are struggling	There is a wide gap in the UK between the rich and the poor, particularly in London, where poverty and wealth live side-by-side. It is the richest city in the country but also its most unequal.  A family could live in a modern property worth £2m and just down the road, three small children could be sharing a damp bedsit with their mum. The situation was recently highlighted in “Bedrooms of London”, a major exhibition about London’s most vulnerable children. The school summer holidays can be a stressful period for low-income families and for the approximately 700,000 children living below the poverty line in the capital. The ones who can afford to take holidays abroad, but for many families stuck in the city, a one-day trip to the nearest British resort village isn’t quite as easy as you’d assume. 
AUG17	If you're a feminist, you have to take the allegations against Katy Perry seriously	What happens when a famous woman is accused of the sexual misconduct that we’ve been taught to expect from powerful men? In the aftermath of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, Katy Perry looks set to find out.  The singer faces allegations of sexual misconduct. Tina Kandelaki, a Russian journalist, claims that Perry touched her without consent and kissed her while intoxicated at an industry party. Model Josh Kloss, who worked with Perry on her Teenage Dream video in 2010, came out with allegations that the singer exposed his genitals without consent to her friends while at a party they attended together. 
AUG17	I found a loudmouth political troll who had stumbled into our non-virtual world – it didn’t end well for him	This summer, we had a street party and closed off our road with permission from the council and I rolled wheelie bins out to block the end of the road. A young Aussie guy bounded out “I’ve got a removal van coming today, you can’t block the road”. He was not aggressive but was telling me, not asking me, to remove the bin bags. “But you’ve known for months we have a party today,” I said. “Everyone was told and kids are going to be playing, we can’t have cars tearing down here”. The man, who seemed to get a little taller as he spoke was uncompromising: “I knew about the party, but this is the only time I had to move house.”

AUG17	The Iranian oil tanker row has left everyone with a win – except bungling John Bolton and the US hawks	When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was wagging his finger at the UK earlier this month shouting “peace for peace, war for war and oil for oil”, he clearly knew very well the vulnerabilities of his British counterparts. He was talking to a rusty political class wearied by Brexit, and decided to play them like a fiddle. The Gibraltar high court decided on Thursday to release the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 after a fierce legal battle, in which President Trump’s administration wanted to nudge the UK further into its pocket, but came out with a bruising humiliation.
AUG17	The Hunt is almost impossible to defend – so why does my intuition tell me it was wrong to ban it?	When it was announced a few days ago that The Hunt, a satirical thriller film about human beings literally hunting other human beings, would never have a theatrical release in the US, I wasn’t particularly heartbroken – but I was puzzled. It’s not every day that a movie gets pulled from American cinemas. When that happens, it usually signals a serious problem with the overall quality of the film rather than the substance of its content. In explanation, a spokesperson from Universal Pictures said that “now is not the right time to release this film”, suggesting someone had decided the film was too violent or divisive to see the light of day. And that's unusual. That The Hunt is a violent movie is not up for debate. That’s obvious, even after watching just the film’s trailer. There’s a reason it’s rated R, and that reason is that it depicts people killing or attempting to kill one another with a variety of weapons, from firearms to the pointy heel of a stiletto. And there’s no denying that its premise is controversial, to say the least. The Hunt depicts a group of people hunting (for fun) a group of other people, who are reportedly referred to as “deplorables” (the term doesn’t appear in the trailer, nor did it appear in the film’s original synopsis, but it has been used in numerous reports about the film.) “Deplorables”, of course, immediately calls to mind the 2016 presidential campaign, when Hillary Clinton used the phrase “basket of deplorables” to refer to part of Donald Trump’s electorate. The term has been re-appropriated and used proudly by Trump’s supporters, in the same way that “Nevertheless, she persisted” became a rallying cry for feminists after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used it in reference to Senator Elizabeth Warren in February 2017, i.e. three lifetimes ago.
AUG18	No-deal Brexit is class war. It’s time to take back control and defeat Johnson and Rees-Mogg once and for all	There was always talk of division in our house. Some of it was literal. Whether Everton or Liverpool would win the old “First Division”. Some of it was actual. Mum was an Evertonian and dad a Liverpudlian – a “mixed marriage” as my grandad would say.
AUG18	The north desperately needs renewal. The government must give us our own budget so we can begin the work	The north of England had reason to celebrate this week as the first Pacer trains retired after more than 3 million miles and more than 30 years in service. They were only intended to be a short-term solution with a lifespan of 20 years – and in that time the patching up of the north’s networks, and the expectation that passengers should just put up with whatever turns up, has been run thin.  Pacers have become symbolic of passenger and political frustration for many reasons, not least because their retirement has long been promised. Similarly, successive governments and prime ministers have promised to turbo-charge the north, but it’s 2019 and commuters are still having to get on converted buses 10 years past their use-by date.
AUG18	I found a loudmouth political troll who had stumbled into our non-virtual world – it didn’t end well for him	This summer, we had a street party and closed off our road with permission from the council and I rolled wheelie bins out to block the end of the road.

AUG18	The Top 10: Backing musicians	John Peters started this one by mentioning Cher as singer for the Ronettes and Reg Dwight on piano for the Hollies.  1. Cher was also a backing singer on “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’”, by The Righteous Brothers, 1964. Thanks to Sharon McVittie. 
AUG18	Grouse shooting is brutal animal cruelty, pure and simple – it needs to be banned	Having counter-beat grouse away from harm and stood in front of the gun butts with other hunt saboteurs on the Derbyshire moors in the past, the argument to me about grouse shooting is just a plain animal cruelty one. I was up on those moors again recently with an old hunt saboteur comrade who was showing me a “stink pit” – a huge pit dug into the ground where all the surplus shot birds are thrown to attract the so-called “vermin”, which are then caught by the myriad traps and snares set by the gamekeepers before being killed and thrown into the pit too.
AUG18	Be honest, do you actually care about the record number of drug-related deaths?	Repeating the same illogical behaviour over and over again may seem absurd, especially when we think of people using illicit drugs like heroin and crack cocaine. But as another record for drug-related deaths is set, 4,327 in the past year alone, it seems the political response to this tragedy is equally irrational.  The increase in drug-related deaths hasn’t suddenly happened, deaths have been rising significantly for years. There has been ample opportunity to think about how to reverse this horrendous trend. And unusually, we know how to do it. The evidence has been collected and made available to ministers. 
AUG18	Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are making Bame people feel less and less that we belong	Although many have condemned Donald Trump’s recent comments regarding four Democratic congresswomen, this has not stopped a flurry of articles and opinion pieces appearing over the last few weeks questioning whether the statement “go back to where you came from” is racist. As far as I am concerned there is no contention here: to argue the case plays into the hands of the politicians who seek to ride on the back of past and present commentary on matters of race. Perhaps the writers of these articles do not recognise the power and legitimacy they give to racist politicians and the outdated, worn-out messages that directly impact Bame communities. But this sort of rhetoric is dangerous, and rather than increasing connection between politicians and the people they serve, it reduces the sense of belonging in society.
AUG18	Hong Kong’s trauma is deep – but by standing with the people, medical workers are providing social healing too	During the Sars epidemic that brought Hong Kong to a virtual standstill in 2003, the surgical mask became the global emblem of a beleaguered city. It condensed and projected the fear, alienation, but also the resilience and ultimately the solidarity of a community under stress.  We look back now at the courage of healthcare workers who laboured at the frontline to treat the sick – a sacrifice commemorated in the Sars memorial garden in Hong Kong Park.
AUG18	Summer holiday attractions for kids are ridiculously extortionate – no wonder low-income families are struggling	There is a wide gap in the UK between the rich and the poor, particularly in London, where poverty and wealth live side-by-side.

AUG19	The US is being pushed towards recession – and it's totally unclear whether Trump understands what he's done	If Donald Trump’s recent tweets are any indication, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell shouldn’t expect an invitation to Mar-a-Lago any time soon. Chairman Powell landed on Trump’s enemies list following the Fed’s recent decision to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 per cent. This is an attempt to safeguard the longest economic expansion in American history – a staggering 121 consecutive months, dating back to June 2009.
AUG19	I don't want to vote for Trump in 2020 – but the Democrats keep pushing me away	Over the weekend, pictures surfaced from Illinois state senator Mark Sandoval’s fundraiser showing constituents pretending to assassinate someone dressed in a Donald Trump mask. As a conservative, I have a special bone to pick with Trump on account of the nearly irreparable damage he is doing to my party, and I find it fairly easy to join with friends across the aisle in condemning much of his abhorrent rhetoric.
AUG19	Dyslexics are discriminated against by the current GCSE exam system – it’s time to go digital	Over 80,000 of the young people collecting GCSE results on Thursday will be dyslexic. If the trend of recent years continues, their chance of getting a good pass in their English language and maths will be just half of that of their peers. Despite being just as able as their classmates, they are twice as likely to fail to get those critical grades. Dyslexic young people are so much less likely to leap this important hurdle in accessing further education and a good job for two reasons – support is frequently inadequate and the system is unnecessarily loaded against them. 
AUG19	How a viral poem about a suicide bomb attack at a wedding cut straight to the heart of Afghan politics	When I was growing up in Kabul, weddings were mixed gatherings. Men wore suits, women were in fashionable dresses. Couples danced together and wedding parties were seen as a break from the pain of daily hardship and war. I recalled all this the moment I saw the terrible pictures of Sunday’s dead, blasted to pieces by a suicide bomber. He walked into the wedding hall; so far, 63 dead, 180 wounded, and Isis claiming responsibility. One of the photographs shows a pile of blood-stained shoes, all worn by the victims at the popular “Dubai Wedding Hall”. Condemnation of the “inhuman” attack – they always use the same word – has been uttered by everyone, including Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, who expressed his fury on Twitter. So what’s new?
AUG19	The north desperately needs renewal. The government must give us our own budget so we can begin the work	The north of England had reason to celebrate this week as the first Pacer trains retired after more than 3 million miles and more than 30 years in service. They were only intended to be a short-term solution with a lifespan of 20 years – and in that time the patching up of the north’s networks, and the expectation that passengers should just put up with whatever turns up, has been run thin.  Pacers have become symbolic of passenger and political frustration for many reasons, not least because their retirement has long been promised. Similarly, successive governments and prime ministers have promised to turbo-charge the north, but it’s 2019 and commuters are still having to get on converted buses 10 years past their use-by date.
AUG19	If we really want to fight climate change and biodiversity loss, we need a national food strategy	When it comes to food, we are surrounded by an abundance that our ancestors could only have dreamed of. One of my new colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spoke about a farmer who described how, when he was a boy in the 1940s, his father had wept as he tore out his hedges to put more land under the plough as his contribution to the heroic efforts that fed this country.
AUG19	If the economy tanks under Trump, prepare for the scariest election of your life in 2020	Since the beginning of his 2016 election campaign, President Trump has been disturbingly willing to capitalise on bigotry and fear for political gain. But if a recession hits before the 2020 election, I fear his twisted rhetoric will only get worse. The notion that the economy is “booming” has long afforded Trump a significant, if reluctant, base of support beyond southern border wall fanatics. This is despite the fact that the national debt has increased substantially under Trump and his irresponsible, ineffective tariffs are almost impossible to reconcile with his free-market principles. Yet Trump’s Republican affiliation gives him a free pass to claim the mantle of fiscal conservatism, which many Americans associate with economic competence, making him a relatively popular choice beyond his MAGA base. 
AUG19	Boris Johnson will be the Alexis Tsipras of 2019. Here’s why	Even though Boris Johnson enjoys reciting the ancient Greek tragic poets from memory, he is increasingly sounding like the Greek prime minister in 2015, Alexis Tsipras. As newly elected leaders, both politicians questioned their predecessors’ deals with the European Union and resorted to populism in an attempt to avoid an unpleasant compromise and a looming ultimatum.   For Tsipras’ Greece, the date with no tomorrow was 30 June, 2015. This was when the bailout programme for Greece would come to an end. Without the financial assistance received under the loan agreement with its creditors (European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund), Greece would be unable to pay the pending instalment of 1.5m euros to the IMF. It would go bankrupt, as indeed happened.
AUG19	If Jeremy Corbyn wanted to do ‘everything necessary’ to stop no-deal Brexit, he’d have a plan	As someone who was becoming mentally – not in that sense – reconciled to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, albeit in a straitjacket and on a strictly time-limited basis, I am even more disappointed than usual to see him fail to rise to the occasion.  Maybe he misunderstands what is going on, not for the first time; or maybe he, or his Svengali-like advisers think they are playing a cunning game. But the idea, it needs to be made clear to the leader of the opposition, is to block no-deal Brexit and put the Brexit issue back to the people in the form of a Final Say referendum. It is not to give him power in any other sense. 
AUG19	The far right say they love free speech – but the attack on Owen Jones shows they hate a critical press	In the early hours of Saturday morning, Owen Jones was attacked in the street by a troop of thugs who “made a beeline” straight for the prominent left-wing journalist. They ambushed him outside an Islington pub, dragged him to the ground, punched and kicked him, leaving him with head injuries and a “bloodied back”. The friends who sprang to his defence were beaten for their trouble. Over recent years, Jones has been subjected to a febrile chorus of death threats, harassment and stalking from the far right – and so, for him, there is no doubt as to the motivation behind this attack.
AUG20	Bernie Sanders has stepped up his attacks on Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. That isn't wise	Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign has stepped up attacks on his Democratic rivals this week as the party’s 2020 presidential primary field narrows, setting its sights, in particular, on Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Kamala Harris. The first shot fired came from Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, who dismissed the threat Warren posed by stating that they are not “competing for the same pool of voters” and that Sanders’ “base is much more diverse”.
AUG20	Democrats are traumatized. That's why they hate Susan Sarandon	Yesterday in Iowa, at an ice cream social, Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon introduced Senator Bernie Sanders to a crowd on the presidential campaign trail. Sarandon, a fanatical Sanders supporter who famously refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016, said of Sanders: “He is not someone who used to be a Republican. ”  On social media, this was interpreted by many as an unnecessary dig against Sander’s closest competitor: Senator Elizabeth Warren. It was made worse by the fact that Sanders has been incredibly careful not to say anything negative about the Massachusetts senator, despite the American media practically begging him to. Predictably, the internet did what it does best and erupted into an anti-Sarandon mob. People were enraged, profanity was used and trolling quickly commenced. 
AUG20	I paid $110,000 to give birth. Stop telling me it's a miracle I'm alive	They say you can’t put a price tag on life. Our healthcare system begs to differ. The cost of my 40-week pregnancy with complications – none of which were caused by pre-existing conditions or lifestyle – was $111,712.83. In November 2018, much to the surprise of my husband and I, I fell pregnant after being told I was infertile. Though we were absolutely shocked and overjoyed, at five weeks pregnant I became very ill. It seemed as my belly grew with a new bursting life inside me, so did the complications, the illness, and the bills. 
AUG20	Generation Z: We've finally reached Peak Zombie	This week’s news that Channel 4 has commissioned Generation Z, a six-part Brexit-inspired zombie series about the clash of generations in a care home, begs the question – why? Creator Ben Wheatley – who previously made hits including Sightseers, Free Fire and Kill List – is fully capable of putting a subversive spin on the tired genre, but viewers will still yawn at the prospect of yet another zombie drama. We are being rendered insensible by a never-ending stream of living dead invading our screens and mobile devices.
AUG20	Men, staying silent isn’t an option – women will face more victim-blaming if you don’t challenge sexual harassment	We’ve known for some time just how big an impact rape culture has had on society. Many of us have also, at some stage, witnessed the nonchalance with which some people treat sexual harassment, even in the face of growing, global, victim-led efforts like the #MeToo movement.  Those whose instincts tell them to side with the accused, rather than at least considering the prospect of taking accusations against them seriously, often express a fear of needlessly tarnishing someone’s reputation. For a man, it’s too big a thing to lose, too much of a risk to their mental and professional wellbeing. Nevermind worrying about the victim’s trauma and the well-documented effects of what surviving an ordeal like sexual harassment does to a person. 
AUG20	Cambridge is being sued for allegedly mishandling sexual harassment – as a former student, I’m not surprised at all	When I saw the news this week that a former student was suing Cambridge University over its handling of her sexual harassment complaint, I wasn’t surprised. As I read the details of Danielle Bradford’s case against my alma mater, I realised there were parts of her experience which could have been lifted straight out and applied to so many other women I knew at university.
AUG20	Brits in Europe aren’t all old and rich – and thanks to Priti Patel we’re about to lose our livelihoods	No one knows what motivated Priti Patel to call time on free movement for EU27 citizens on 31 October, come what may. But we can be pretty certain that the prospect of reciprocal consequences for the 1.3 million UK nationals living on the continent weren’t number one on her list of priorities when she made it. That’s not surprising given that the UK government has consistently framed free movement as a one-way immigration system that allows people from the EU to live and work in the UK unfettered and unchecked. The fact that so many UK citizens have also benefited, on a reciprocal basis, from free movement appears not to have registered with large numbers of our fellow citizens. For them, Aufwiedersehen Pet, was just an amusing television show, not a reminder of a time when jobless Brits left the UK and travelled to Germany in search of work after the destruction of British industry in the 1980s.
AUG20	I left British Airways because it refused to stop deportations	When I got a job with British Airways I was so proud I was going to be flying around the world, experiencing new foods, smells and cultures and enjoying life. I was young and fresh out of education and excited to work for such a respected airline. Working for British Airways was a glamorous and elegant role, a personification of the notion that the world is your oyster. 
AUG20	Iain Duncan Smith’s plan to raise the pension age to 75 is utterly cruel. This is class warfare	There is a myth that as a country we cannot afford our state pensions. And that myth is central to Iain Duncan Smith’s proposals to raise the state pension age to 75.  But there is a problem with the premise of IDS’s bright idea. The reality is that according to the OBR, public spending on the state pension is expected to rise by less than 1 per cent of GDP between 2017-18 and 2022-23. 
AUG20	The NYPD officer accused of killing Eric Garner has been fired. Don't tell me I should be happy	Black America mourned Eric Garner for five years, and today, we supposedly got justice. Officer Pantaleo, the man who killed Garner using an illegal chokehold, was fired from the New York Police Department.  Maybe I could accept that as firing as enough three years ago. But we all waited patiently for America to hold Pantaleo accountable for five years. Groups like Black Lives Matter organized; activists called for systemic reform; we marched, protested, and we called for Garner’s death to be a turning point. We really thought it might be.
AUG21	There is nothing more cynical than Trump calling Jews who vote Democrat 'disloyal'	President Trump has caused outrage by criticising Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats. Speaking to the press in the Oval Office about Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar – the Democratic congresswomen recently barred from entering Israel over their involvement in the movement to end international support for the country because of its policies towards Palestinians – Trump said that Jewish people voting Democrat show “either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty." Since Omar and Tlaib’s Congressional inauguration in January, their criticism of the Israeli government has made them hate figures of the evangelical right. This has inspired Trump to assume his most unlikely role yet: the Jew defender. Or so he thinks.
AUG21	Jill Biden wants us all to settle for her husband. But there's a very good reason why we don't have to do that	It appears that former Second Lady Jill Biden believes that we’ve all had our fun this primary season, but it’s time to stop pretending we don’t know how this is all going to end and why.  While campaigning in New Hampshire, Biden asked Democrats to prioritize what the media and the consulting contingent have described as “electability” over enthusiasm for other specific candidates or their policies. “You may like another candidate better, but you have to look at who is going to win,” she said while addressing a group of educators. “And if education is your main issue, Joe is that person.”
AUG21	I'm an immigrant in America on an 'Einstein visa'. But my parents have never been allowed to visit me	I am an alien of extraordinary ability. No, really: that is my official designation after I successfully applied for a green card through the “Einstein Visa” pathway. 
AUG21	Single mothers like me would do anything for their kids – how dare this NHS trust say we're bad parents	I spotted a meme doing the rounds on social media after the most recent mass shooting in the states suggesting that the majority of these killers come from single-parent families, so the American government should consider “single mum control” rather than gun control. And although NHS South East London’s recent claim that single mums are a burden on society  – given as a reason for denying single women IVF treatment – aren’t quite as inflammatory as that, they definitely come from the same school of misogyny.  The report states that “single mothers are generally poorer; they are likely to have greater support needs compared to two-parent couples, thereby placing a greater burden on society in general.” It’s nothing most single mums, including me, haven’t heard a million times before – and often much worse. We sit around all day counting our benefits while watching daytime TV. Our kids are doomed to fail. They’ll perform badly at school and grow up into new drains on the economy. They’ll pick up guns and go on killing sprees. The list of awful things we single mums are responsible for is endless. 
AUG21	Bernie Sanders has stepped up his attacks on Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. That isn't wise	Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign has stepped up attacks on his Democratic rivals this week as the party’s 2020 presidential primary field narrows, setting its sights, in particular, on Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Kamala Harris.

AUG21	The Harland and Wolff workers want to make renewable energy. A Labour government would help them	A Westminster framing of the struggle over the historic Harland and Wolff shipyards narrow it to one of market versus state: “a purely commercial matter” says Boris Johnson, typically ducking the problem. “We will bring the yards into public ownership,” says John McDonnell anticipating Labour’s plans for government led industrial reconstruction. The shipyard workers themselves, however, now occupying the yards are taking the search for an alternative to a deeper level, addressing the substantive issue of production itself, envisaging a future based not on the fantasy of a return to the grand Titanic style liners of the past but on producing the infrastructure and inner working of equipment for generating renewable energy through harnessing the power of the wind and the waves .
AUG21	I was embarrassed to be a Brit abroad this summer – but what I came home to is far worse	Shortly after the Brexit vote, I wrote about feeling slightly embarrassed as a Brit going abroad in the wake of the nationalist bile it had unleashed. The Twitter response was predictable. I knew I’d pushed the right buttons when a woman whose avatar was a picture of the white cliffs of Dover mocked up with “full up” up in gruesome red graffiti asked me how I dared to write such a piece. What a patriot.  In the intervening period, that bile has turned into raw hydrochloric stomach acid as the ugly reality of the project has been revealed. The exposure of the lies that were told by Boris Johnson and his chums during the campaign has simply led to an escalating spiral of increasingly aggressive falsehood. 
AUG21	I've been talking to Hong Kong's protesters and this is their message for Boris Johnson	Last weekend, the zombie government in Hong Kong took little notice of the peaceful, defiant, dignified and polite protests that were emerging. But as temperatures and tensions rise in the region, political solutions feel increasingly out of reach and international concern is beginning to grow.
AUG21	Brits in Europe aren’t all old and rich – and thanks to Priti Patel we’re about to lose our livelihoods	No one knows what motivated Priti Patel to call time on free movement for EU27 citizens on 31 October, come what may. But we can be pretty certain that the prospect of reciprocal consequences for the 1.3 million UK nationals living on the continent weren’t number one on her list of priorities when she made it.

AUG21	As a Conservative student, I know that there's no free speech crisis in our universities – it's a dangerous myth	Before I left home for university last year, I was led to believe that I was in for the toughest three years of my life. "Free speech is a fantasy on university campuses," I was solemnly assured. As a neoliberal conservative student of Sociology, the right-leaning media led me to expect militant left-wing mobs watching my every move and a furious thought-police ready to pounce upon the slightest misstep. I knew what I was up against, and I was prepared to face the almighty consequences of political self-expression. In reality, my student experience was totally different. Even as a Tory, I can see clearly that the vast majority of this rhetoric is stemming from the right. This is not a deranged cry from the fringe, but a mainstream perspective; people truly believe that students’ rights are somehow weaker than everyone else’s, to the point that the government created the Office for Students with the express purpose of safeguarding free speech on campus.
AUG22	At the White House this week, I asked Donald Trump what he thought of American Jews – and he told me	Reporters like me who spend their days in Washington DC can always tell whether the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has mucked things up in a particularly spectacular way by taking a quick glance at the White House's driveway. Over the 164 days that have passed since the White House Press Secretary stood behind the iconic lectern for a daily press briefing, the driveway immediately outside the West Wing has become one of the only places where reporters can reliably hope to put a question in the ear of the public servants responsible for carrying out the President's agenda. 
AUG22	The United Nations has a secret funding crisis – and I know because I work there	The United Nations is gripped by a secret cash flow crisis, the scale of which it hasn’t seen since Ronald Regan started to withhold contributions to gain political leverage in the 1980s. Now, while the budget is “secure”, major donors – including the USA –  are withholding their contributions, causing pressures that will have an impact far beyond its nerve centres. The UN accrues its budget on a pretty simple premise: everyone pays a percentage of their GDP, with the United States never paying more than 22 per cent. Since it was established in 1945 the system has by and large worked. Almost all the countries in the world make up the “Member States” of the United Nations, and as the arc of human development by and large bends towards peace, the inertia created by 193 Member States having an “equal” voice in effect causes countries to by and large hammer out issues through dialogue. If you want a voice, you need to pay. But the kicker is that you can run into arrears for two years without losing it.
AUG22	Jill Biden wants us all to settle for her husband. But there's a very good reason why we don't have to do that	It appears that former Second Lady Jill Biden believes that we’ve all had our fun this primary season, but it’s time to stop pretending we don’t know how this is all going to end and why.  While campaigning in New Hampshire, Biden asked Democrats to prioritize what the media and the consulting contingent have described as “electability” over enthusiasm for other specific candidates or their policies. “You may like another candidate better, but you have to look at who is going to win,” she said while addressing a group of educators. “And if education is your main issue, Joe is that person.”

AUG22	A century after the Anglo-Afghan peace treaty, the Fourth Afghan War is about to escalate	While Afghans are supposed to be celebrating this week’s blood-soaked hundredth anniversary of their “independence” from Britain, signed off in the sweltering Raj military city of Rawalpindi in 1919, their most powerful militia is negotiating further “independence” from the Americans in an air-conditioned conference hall in Doha. A hundred years ago, “Pindi” was the British army’s capital in northwestern India. Today, it’s a dingy appendix to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. A century ago, Qatar was run by the Al-Thani family under British “protection” after 40 years of sleepy Ottoman rule and the present-day capital of Doha was a tired pearl-fishers’ town. Today the Al-Thani family is still in charge of what is now a gleaming oil and gas metropolis; and Qatar, with investments in Sainsbury’s, Heathrow airport and West End hotels (the list goes on to the crack of doom) probably owns more of London than the Queen. So much for the British Empire.
AUG22	Emmanuel Macron is refusing to take the blame for Boris Johnson's lies – but that doesn't mean they'll stop	Boris Johnson’s career only makes sense once you’ve worked out it is a kind of bull****-themed escape room. Find the lie that opens the door and takes you to the next level, then the next one, then the next one, and once each has closed behind you there’s not a thing the truth can do about it (at least for now). It is why, for example, during the Tory leadership contest, whenever he was asked what his actual Brexit strategy was, he would, every single time, offer words very much along the lines of: you disaggregate the elements of the otherwise defunct withdrawal agreement. You keep the parts on which there is agreement, and you get rid of the parts you do not.
AUG22	Emmanuel Macron now wants to force Britain out of the EU – and fast	It is a too little appreciated fact that France can expel Britain from the European Union. President Macron can do this by simply refusing to re-open the Withdrawal Agreement and by vetoing any further extension to the Article 50 procedure. Thus, even if the British Parliament were to “seize back” control and seek more time for, say, a general election, Emmanuel Macron could still say “Non!” He might even do so if the UK asks for the time to hold another referendum – though that be a lot tougher for him to pull off.   Macron holds the power to end the unending Brexit crisis, and his exasperation is palpable.
AUG22	I've been losing my hair since my teens. Trust me, Gary Lineker – baldness is not a joke	Baldness has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. The warning signs were always there. Having inherited almost all of my physical characteristics from my mother’s side, I spent my entire childhood being cautioned by various relatives that I was likely to follow the same follicular trajectory as my grandfather and uncles, and lose my hair prematurely. As predicted, my hairline began to recede at 16 but, thanks largely to an injection of olive-skinned, thick-haired DNA from my father, I didn’t experience significant balding until my early thirties
AUG23	No, Boris Johnson is not the ‘British Trump’	It feels like everyone is comparing — or connecting — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson with Donald Trump these days; the US President did it himself last month while talking to students at a summit and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed the sentiment while talking to a crowd in Northamptonshire. Just this week, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the UK would effectively become a “vassal” of the US if it leaves the EU without a deal. I understand why people are drawing comparisons between the New York-born Johnson and Trump. They’re both unconventional politicians; they have been – or can be – hard to pin down ideologically; they’ve both used the system to undermine groups of people, and are media-savvy. Johnson was a newspaper reporter in a former life, while Trump is a former reality-show star. You could even argue that Johnson has an “American-ness” about him — he appears to be straight-talking, he’s unashamedly patriotic, and, like him or loathe him, Johnson is as charismatic as his Republican counterpart. Let’s not forget that both men have been accused of — and rely on — being seen as buffoonish. Trump’s intellect is called into question on a regular basis, and I can never un-see Johnson’s zipline snafu.
AUG23	David Koch reshaped America for the worse. His life's work was the destruction of others	How does one eulogize a villain? It’s a question I find myself asking today after reading the news that David H Koch has died. What else can we really call a man who spent his entire adult life enriching himself at the expense of the world around him, leaving in his wake millions of destroyed lives, a planet on the brink of ecological catastrophe, and a nuclear superpower governed by a far-right political party?  While it is generally impolitic to castigate someone after death, in the case of David Koch, it’s hard not to point out that his life’s work was the destruction of others. 
AUG23	David Koch's legacy wasn't perfect – but it was far more positive than you've been led to believe	David Koch, the political philanthropist who nearly everyone has an opinion on, has passed away at the age of 79. Many remember him as a cartoon villain of modern politics; however, the truth of his legacy is that, along with his brother, he championed many positive and noble causes that tend to be supported across the political aisle.  David was philosophically a libertarian, and even once, in 1980, ran as the VP candidate on the Libertarian Party ticket. 
AUG23	The Top 10: Statements that came back to bite their author	This list was inspired by a colleague who asked where the phrase “burning injustices” in a Jeremy Corbyn speech originally came from (it was a reference to Theresa May’s words in Downing Street when she became prime minister). And thanks to Jonathan Portes, who proposed a similar, overlapping Top 10 of people whose most famous statement, in their field of expertise, was wrong – which certainly applies to the first two.  1. “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” Irving Fisher (described by Joseph Schumpeter as “the greatest economist the United States has ever produced”), nine days before the Wall Street Crash, 1929. Nominated by Jonathan Portes.
AUG23	The United Nations has a secret funding crisis – and I know because I work there	The United Nations is gripped by a secret cash flow crisis, the scale of which it hasn’t seen since Ronald Regan started to withhold contributions to gain political leverage in the 1980s.

AUG23	Every meat-eater on the planet is helping to fuel the Amazon forest fires – here’s how	The world’s lungs are on fire. The Amazon ablaze dominates front pages. Inaction from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is centre stage at this weekend’s G7 in Biarritz. Heart-breaking videos of indigenous peoples running from their homes and of animals fleeing for their lives have spread over social media. According to Brazil’s Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, 74,155 fires have been spotted in 2019 so far – an 84 per cent increase from the same period last year. Around one million indigenous people from up to 500 tribes are at risk.
AUG23	As someone who's visited refugees in Calais, I know the crisis is far from over	On my second day working in one of the refugee camps in northern France, one of the younger men spoke of his hopes for the future. He eagerly told me that getting to England is what's keeping him going. It's all he thinks about – every day, every night. This remarkable hope and extraordinary resilience has continued to strike me when working with the refugees; we need to continue to give them hope for a more stable life through offering our support until a better long term solution is put in place.
AUG23	Tribal politics are stopping us uniting against a no-deal Brexit – I have a solution to the current deadlock	Historically, our country has valued being calm in a crisis. We like coming together in the face of adversity. During times of national emergency, our politicians have put aside the petty prejudices of party loyalties to form national governments – working together to lead the country out of turmoil. At other times, they have formed alliances in elections. As the Johnson government hurtles towards a no-deal exit from the EU, the time for politicians of all stripes to go the extra mile in working together has surely come. Brexit has already provoked a flurry of cross-party letter writing, earnest meetings and wise nodding across the House of Commons chamber. We now need MPs not just to commentate in chorus, but to work together to secure office for an alternative administration.
AUG23	A century after the Anglo-Afghan peace treaty, the Fourth Afghan War is about to escalate	While Afghans are supposed to be celebrating this week’s blood-soaked hundredth anniversary of their “independence” from Britain, signed off in the sweltering Raj military city of Rawalpindi in 1919, their most powerful militia is negotiating further “independence” from the Americans in an air-conditioned conference hall in Doha. A hundred years ago, “Pindi” was the British army’s capital in northwestern India. Today, it’s a dingy appendix to the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. A century ago, Qatar was run by the Al-Thani family under British “protection” after 40 years of sleepy Ottoman rule and the present-day capital of Doha was a tired pearl-fishers’ town. Today the Al-Thani family is still in charge of what is now a gleaming oil and gas metropolis; and Qatar, with investments in Sainsbury’s, Heathrow airport and West End hotels (the list goes on to the crack of doom) probably owns more of London than the Queen. So much for the British Empire.
AUG24	Boris Johnson could be out of the job within months – here’s how Ken Clarke would replace him	Kenneth Clarke really could be prime minister in two months’ time. We have hardly begun to work out the weird scenarios that could play out in parliament after it reconvenes on 3 September – and a temporary prime minister presiding over a general election before the end of the year is more likely than people think.  Two MPs who have spent August thinking hard about what might happen are Caroline Lucas, of the Greens, and Nick Boles, the former Conservative. They both want to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal which, despite polite words from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron about an “amended” deal, still seems the likely destination of Boris Johnson’s policy. 
AUG24	As a teenager, I believe our mental health is harmed by this dehumanising education system	On GCSE results day this week, I couldn’t help but cast my mind back to the daunting day last year as I walked through the school gates with my parents, trying my best to read my teachers’ faces thinking: are my results catastrophic? Have I failed? My teacher is refusing to make eye contact, I must have bombed it... and so on. I remember feeling through the envelope, trying to guess the results, as I rushed through the rain to find a quiet spot where I could face what felt like monumental news to me at the time. It felt like my world would come crashing down if I did not hit the marks. My future rested on what was in that envelope, my happiness relied on those letters and numbers. This is what rushes through many 16-year-olds’ minds. This is what it feels like for the majority of young people collecting their results this week. This is the reality.  
AUG24	David Koch's legacy wasn't perfect – but it was far more positive than you've been led to believe	David Koch, the political philanthropist who nearly everyone has an opinion on, has passed away at the age of 79. Many remember him as a cartoon villain of modern politics; however, the truth of his legacy is that, along with his brother, he championed many positive and noble causes that tend to be supported across the political aisle.  David was philosophically a libertarian, and even once, in 1980, ran as the VP candidate on the Libertarian Party ticket. 
AUG24	Single mothers like me would do anything for their kids – how dare this NHS trust say we're bad parents	I spotted a meme doing the rounds on social media after the most recent mass shooting in the states suggesting that the majority of these killers come from single-parent families, so the American government should consider “single mum control” rather than gun control. And although NHS South East London’s recent claim that single mums are a burden on society  – given as a reason for denying single women IVF treatment – aren’t quite as inflammatory as that, they definitely come from the same school of misogyny.  The report states that “single mothers are generally poorer; they are likely to have greater support needs compared to two-parent couples, thereby placing a greater burden on society in general.” It’s nothing most single mums, including me, haven’t heard a million times before – and often much worse. We sit around all day counting our benefits while watching daytime TV. Our kids are doomed to fail. They’ll perform badly at school and grow up into new drains on the economy. They’ll pick up guns and go on killing sprees. The list of awful things we single mums are responsible for is endless. 
AUG24	Why Spider-Man fans could benefit from his departure from Marvel	Just as Sony was celebrating Spider-Man: Far From Home as its highest grossing film, someone let it be known that the web slinger’s tenure in Disney’s all conquering Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is coming to an end as a result of the two studios falling out. Talk about a party pooper. For the uninitiated, Sony has the rights to Spider-Man and a string of related characters. However, the two struck a deal to bring him into the MCU, which included the involvement of wunderkind producer Kevin Feige in the franchise, that gave Disney a cut of the opening box office and the merchandising rights. 
AUG24	If the Lib Dems learn the lessons of the past, they could be in with a real chance in the next election	The local and European parliamentary elections this May provided a striking turn around, looking back.  For the Lib Dems they meant after years of polling consistently below 10 per cent, a sudden burst in support saw them take a slew of council and EU parliament seats and poll as high as 24 per cent in June. 
AUG24	No, Boris Johnson is not the ‘British Trump’	It feels like everyone is comparing — or connecting — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson with Donald Trump these days; the US President did it himself last month while talking to students at a summit and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed the sentiment while talking to a crowd in Northamptonshire. Just this week, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the UK would effectively become a “vassal” of the US if it leaves the EU without a deal. I understand why people are drawing comparisons between the New York-born Johnson and Trump. They’re both unconventional politicians; they have been – or can be – hard to pin down ideologically; they’ve both used the system to undermine groups of people, and are media-savvy. Johnson was a newspaper reporter in a former life, while Trump is a former reality-show star. You could even argue that Johnson has an “American-ness” about him — he appears to be straight-talking, he’s unashamedly patriotic, and, like him or loathe him, Johnson is as charismatic as his Republican counterpart. Let’s not forget that both men have been accused of — and rely on — being seen as buffoonish. Trump’s intellect is called into question on a regular basis, and I can never un-see Johnson’s zipline snafu.
AUG24	David Koch reshaped America for the worse. His life's work was the destruction of others	How does one eulogize a villain? It’s a question I find myself asking today after reading the news that David H Koch has died. What else can we really call a man who spent his entire adult life enriching himself at the expense of the world around him, leaving in his wake millions of destroyed lives, a planet on the brink of ecological catastrophe, and a nuclear superpower governed by a far-right political party?  While it is generally impolitic to castigate someone after death, in the case of David Koch, it’s hard not to point out that his life’s work was the destruction of others. 
AUG25	I lost my brother to a terrorist bombing – but I know deserting British dual national Isis recruits isn’t right	In recent interventions, the war has been won but we have failed to secure enduring peace. Insurgents have been overpowered or forced to disperse, only to then regroup and return with a vengeance. In modern day non-state conflict, it is no longer enough to defeat the enemy. We need to face the fact that the character of conflict has changed and international law has not kept pace with this changing landscape. In Syria’s case, Isis’s “caliphate” has been removed but the enemy, the ideology and the threat are still very much in existence, albeit largely now in prison camps – and the country is calling out for help. 
AUG25	For a brief period before the Kashmir crisis, humanity in the subcontinent trumped propaganda – not anymore	A decade ago, slipping into the Orientation Hall on a wet Autumn morning at Oxford, I was relieved to find I wasn’t the only one late. “We’re working Indian Standard Time,” a voice whispered. “Fashionably late.” It belonged to a boy from Delhi.  We both laughed at the inside joke that only people hailing from the subcontinent understood. “I’m from Pakistan,” I clarified. “Same difference!” he responded. Instantly, I knew we’d become fast friends. That’s exactly how it happened and a few months down, we began a blog called “Daal (lentils) and Kalashnikovs” – mirroring the puzzling, paradoxical affair between our homelands. Later, when I moved out of Pakistan, whenever we wanted a desi omelette or had to explain my vinegar allergy at a restaurant, my husband requested for an Indian server. “They get us.” Chalking our dietary idiosyncrasies in shared dialect always proved simpler. After all, 73 years ago, India and Pakistan weren’t ruptured countries.
AUG25	Life is actually better than it has ever been for humans – we’re just so swayed by pessimism that we don’t know it	I was once an eco-pessimist. I’ll admit it. I believed that the world was doomed and humanity was stunting its own growth. I could not have been further from the truth. It is now a popular trend to jump on the doomsayer bandwagon and depict the world as a tale of woe. Not only is this trope detached from reality, more importantly it is not based on evidence. It is rather easy to fall into the trap of thinking that despite the Enlightenment’s championing of reason, science, humanism and moral progress, modern life has not got much better. Just look at existence of terrorism, drones, sweatshops, gangs, trafficking, refugees and inequalities, an eco-pessimist would say. In fact, you will rarely see anyone provide an optimistic view of the world and this progressophobia stems from an unpreparedness for the possibility that the human condition has improved.
AUG25	As a French person, I'm ashamed of how much my country protects people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen	For a while, it seemed as though A Rainy Day in New York, the film made by Woody Allen, would never accrue much global cachet. It was disavowed by its stars at the onset of the MeToo movement, when allegations of child sexual abuse made against Allen by his daughter Dylan Farrow resurfaced. Amazon shelved the film earlier this year amid the controversy and no distributor has picked it up in the US so far. Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Hall and Griffin Newman, who are all part of the cast, donated their salary to charities such as RAINN and Time’s Up, while Selena Gomez made a donation exceeding her earnings to the latter. The message seemed clear: art matters, but so do sexual misconduct allegations, and stars no longer wished to be associated with Allen as long as those accusations endured.

AUG25	Scarlett Moffatt’s ‘The Tribe Next Door’ shows our obsession with gawping at cultures while ignoring our own colonial history	Yesterday, it was revealed that Scarlett Moffatt, of Channel 4’s Gogglebox, will star in a new show called The British Tribe Next Door. In the programme, Moffatt and her family will be living alongside the Himba tribe in Namibia, residing in an exact replica of their County Durham semi-detached house.  I’m not making this up – somebody genuinely took this bizarre, outdated and seriously problematic idea and turned it into a television programme. We’re all familiar with these “us vs them” style documentaries. Confidently presenting themselves as “social experiments”, producers make wide-eyed claims about such shows bringing us all closer – bridging cultural divides to highlight a universal humanity. But generally, they do the exact opposite – compounding our conceptions of “otherness” through crude methods and cack-handed comparisons. 
AUG25	Women at the Fringe have been putting up with sexual harassment for decades – it’s about time we spoke up	If you’ve ever been to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, you’ll know that it’s impossible to walk about the place without having a flyer thrust into your hands by a performer in full costume, trying to promote their show, in competition with thousands of others doing the same. You end up with fistfuls of advertising that you have no idea what to do with, for shows that you have no intention of seeing – sometimes simply because time is finite, and sometimes because a show starring three students dressed as sexy ducks doesn’t immediately seem like your thing. I have never had the heart to shake my head and scuttle off, so I earnestly assure the flyerer that I will most definitely be attending their show which starts at exactly the same time as my own. Then I stuff the flyers into my bag and use the better ones to decorate a wall in my house, so that I’ll have a bit of the Fringe in my home all year round.

AUG26	A Brexit deal will not redeem Boris Johnson from his own shame. He is beyond salvation	Perhaps only to be contrarian, and perhaps entirely incorrectly, I have always taken a dim view of the achievements of Sir Ernest Shackleton. His great voyage across Antarctica set off three years after the South Pole had already been reached. His boat was crushed by sea ice long before Antarctica had managed to raise itself above the horizon. Miracle. Nevertheless, he somehow compelled his men to paddle their way to safety at South Georgia Island, in tiny lifeboats, 720 miles across freezing ocean.
AUG26	If Iran holds its nerve and stays in the nuclear deal until next year, it could beat Trump at his own game	For much of Donald Trump’s reign, Iran has exercised patience. Only in recent months has it ramped up pressure on adversaries by grabbing or allegedly sabotaging private ships at sea and inching forward with dormant aspects of its nuclear programme.  But in addition to the possibility that Trump could leave the White House on 21 January 2021 and a friendlier US president could come into office, there are other approaching deadlines that might be moderating Iran’s behaviour; one is beginning to catch the attention of policymakers in the west.

AUG26	Live-streaming ‘Paedophile hunting’ is on the rise – but are people right to take the law into their own hands?	Since becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has made promises to the public through several law and order announcements which will affect England and Wales. One proposal is that 20,000 more police officers will be hired by 2022. There is pressure on Johnson to deliver on this recruitment plan following mounting scrutiny from both members of the cabinet, and a proportion of the general public who equate a link between police numbers and the increase of violent crime.

AUG26	Disabled women are being constantly groped without their consent – even by people who think they are helping	“There is nothing I can do to force people to see me as a human being and respect my boundaries. It is hell.” These are the words of Alyssa, a visually impaired woman describing her frustration at being touched by strangers without her consent. Her voice is echoed by the many respondents we have had to a research project, Private Places Public Spaces, which aims to highlight how disabled women experience non-consensual touching. There have been more than 60 contributions so far, including stories of women being groped, punched and sexually assaulted; being dragged onto trains; being verbally abused and insulted, or pushed into the road. The most common theme to emerge is that being touched without consent is a daily experience for disabled women.

AUG27	I will do everything I can to stop a no-deal bankers’ Brexit	Our country is heading into a crisis this autumn, with Boris Johnson’s Tories driving us towards a no-deal cliff edge. No deal would destroy people’s jobs, push up food prices in the shops and open our NHS to takeover by US private corporations. We will do everything necessary to stop a disastrous no deal for which this government has no mandate. That’s why on Tuesday I am hosting a meeting of opposition parties to discuss how we can stop Johnson’s reckless rush for a no-deal Brexit. The stakes couldn’t be higher.
AUG27	The Democratic nomination is a three-horse race between Biden, Bernie and Warren. That's a good thing for everyone	It has often felt, over the past few months, like every Democrat and their dog, cat, pet parakeet and 30 to 50 feral hogs is running for president. The gargantuan size of the Democratic primary field – which now stands at 20 candidates, after some dropouts – has been bemoaned by voters and pundits alike. It’s easy to see why, as there’s been no shortage of vanity runs from politicians that most voters have never heard of, who stand little chance of winning. Many want the party to get on with finding person to take on Trump quickly, then unite behind them ahead of November 2020. Anxiety at the prospect of a long primary race with the potential to damage and divide the Democratic Party is understandable. The divisions of the bruising 2016 race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are still very much existent, with each camp still blaming the other for Clinton’s traumatic loss to Trump.

AUG27	Saving wildlife requires a new approach	As the Amazon burns, heated debates play out in Geneva this week at the triennial CITES World Wildlife Conference, including on trade in elephant ivory. They are critical, intense and at times passionate, and CITES, the global wildlife trade regulator, can claim some success in ensuring trade in endangered species does not threaten their survival.  However, global efforts to save biodiversity more broadly have largely failed, with declining trend lines continuing notwithstanding the adoption of a suite of agreements, most notably the UN Convention on Biodiversity in 1992. Something is not working.

AUG27	This is the one thing Jeremy Corbyn shouldn't do if he wants to stop a no-deal Brexit	The Labour leader has been calling for an election for so long that he’ll have to agree if the prime minister asks for one, right? Not so fast. Jeremy Corbyn would certainly need a reason to deny Boris Johnson an election if that’s what the Tory leader wants. But there is an exceptionally good reason to say no: there isn’t really time to hold one and get a new prime minister into Downing Street before we’re scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. The priority must be to delay Brexit, otherwise an election might be pointless as we might already have crashed out of the EU by the time a new prime minister is in place. What’s more, it will probably be better to hold a referendum rather than an election – and that would need a delay too. So securing extra time should be the focus of Corbyn’s talks with MPs from other opposition parties today.
AUG27	I just bought a house in France to escape the grotesque project that Brexit has become – and I’m not the only one	There’s a theory that when faced with imminent danger, humans instinctively enter one of two states; fight or flight. When it comes to Brexit, having exhaustively pursued the “fight” route, I’m now firmly in flight mode. The European Union has shaped my life. Growing up in a poor household in an area of industrial decline, I developed a natural talent for languages and a yearning to reap the benefits of the opportunities offered by free movement across what was then 14 other European countries. I would lie In bed, looking up at the yellow stars I had meticulously stuck to my blue bedroom ceiling and dream of broadening my horizons. 
AUG27	Where was this concern about Amazon fires when the EU signed off a huge South American trade deal?	The Amazon is burning. It’s been burning for years. Don’t you remember at school, your environmentally conscious teacher would sit your class down with a string of videos showing the devastation in one of the most incredible regions in the world? These videos would show the large-scale deforestation, would explain that the Amazon is the most important ecosystem on Earth, and would show indigenous people being stripped of their homes and livelihoods.
AUG28	John Bercow is itching to stop Brexit – and there isn’t much the government can do to get in his way	When Charles I arrived in the chamber of the House of Commons in January 1642, armed guards in tow, to arrest a group of MPs for treason, it was the speaker who stood in his way. Instead of giving up the so-called traitors, speaker William Lenthall rebuked the King and reasserted the power of the Commons, telling Charles, “I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me.” The struggle for power between executive and legislature is not a new one. But the possibility of John Bercow taking the lead in the battle to stop Brexit offers the prospect of a modern-day stand-off, every bit as compelling as the one that took place in the months before the Civil War. It’s not Jeremy Corbyn, Yvette Cooper or Ken Clarke who’s best-placed to stop Brexit, but Bercow himself.
AUG28	I voted Republican in Texas for 20 years. Believe the hype – a blue wave is coming	In recent weeks, there have been many reports that Texas might turn blue at the 2020 election. In 2018’s midterm elections, now presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke came close to ousting incumbent republican Senator Ted Cruz in what was a historic election day with record voter turnout. What many don’t realize is that, while Beto was responsible for record new and Latinx voter turnout, the seismic shift to the left was aided by a movement has been years in the making. The Texas capital, Austin, has always been a bastion of blue in the red sea of Texas politics. However, Austin’s suburbs, where I lived for 20 years, are more conservative. Like many of my neighbours, I never voted for Democrats at the national level, and certainly not for president. Williamson County – a suburb near my north Austin home – along with Tarrant County near Dallas, were two of the most conservative counties in Texas.

Something is not working.
AUG28	This government has learned nothing from the Windrush scandal – just ask any doctor	This government’s policy to end free NHS care for all EU citizens who are not ordinarily resident in the UK after 31 October in the event of a no-deal Brexit is both discriminatory and short-sighted. Many EU citizens living in this great country feel affronted that they may be asked to prove their right to NHS care after Brexit, as the government ratchets up its hostile environment rhetoric. Has it learned nothing from Windrush? Speak to any NHS manager or doctor about how they will administer this policy, and many will tell you just how unworkable and unethical it is. The job of NHS staff is to ensure patients get treated, not to act like border guards. This approach does nothing to engender goodwill in EU member states. The Johnson magic money tree will need to be shaken once again as the NHS struggles to cope with thousands of retired British citizens living in the EU coming home to seek NHS care after a no-deal Brexit.
AUG28	Live-streaming ‘Paedophile hunting’ is on the rise – but are people right to take the law into their own hands?	Since becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has made promises to the public through several law and order announcements which will affect England and Wales. One proposal is that 20,000 more police officers will be hired by 2022. There is pressure on Johnson to deliver on this recruitment plan following mounting scrutiny from both members of the cabinet, and a proportion of the general public who equate a link between police numbers and the increase of violent crime.
AUG28	Life is actually better than it has ever been for humans – we’re just so swayed by pessimism that we don’t know it	I was once an eco-pessimist. I’ll admit it. I believed that the world was doomed and humanity was stunting its own growth. I could not have been further from the truth. It is now a popular trend to jump on the doomsayer bandwagon and depict the world as a tale of woe. Not only is this trope detached from reality, more importantly it is not based on evidence. It is rather easy to fall into the trap of thinking that despite the Enlightenment’s championing of reason, science, humanism and moral progress, modern life has not got much better. Just look at existence of terrorism, drones, sweatshops, gangs, trafficking, refugees and inequalities, an eco-pessimist would say. In fact, you will rarely see anyone provide an optimistic view of the world and this progressophobia stems from an unpreparedness for the possibility that the human condition has improved.
AUG28	When Trump meets with Rouhani, he should be careful not to treat him like Kim Jong-un	A major breakthrough has emerged in US-Iran tensions, thanks to French President Emanuel Macron. Macron, who hosted world leaders for the G7 summit in Southern France over the weekend, invited an unexpected guest to the high-profile gathering. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif suddenly landed in the French town of Biarritz on Sunday, where President Trump and other world leaders had been meeting. The surprise visit was part of Macron’s attempts to mediate between Trump and Tehran, after months of high tension in the Persian Gulf. Iran’s top diplomat, who was recently sanctioned by the Trump administration, proudly tweeted photos of his meetings with the French President, and the foreign and finance ministers. Javad Zarif then left France as quickly as he had arrived, and flew back to Tehran with an important message for Iranian leaders back home.
AUG28	There is nothing normal about this. Boris Johnson is running from scrutiny because he has no Brexit plan	The government’s decision to seek to prorogue parliament for over a month has rightly been described by the speaker John Bercow as a “constitutional outrage”. Whatever the prime minister may claim, there is nothing normal about this at all. What he is trying to do is to prevent the House of Commons from holding him and the government to account at this absolutely crucial time for our country and its future. Upholding the principle of parliamentary scrutiny is something we should all support, whatever our views on Brexit. Boris Johnson is doing this because he knows that there isn’t support in the House of Commons for a no-deal Brexit, and his plain purpose is to make it more difficult for MPs to prevent it by means of legislation. MPs who oppose no deal will therefore have to act with speed, determination and unity when the House returns next week. It really is now or never.
AUG28	Boris Johnson goes nuclear with a plan to sideline parliament. The no-deal rebels need a nuclear response	If any MPs doubted Boris Johnson’s determination to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, they will not do so now. The prime minister has dramatically announced he will stage a Queen’s Speech on 14 October. It is an attempt to deprive MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit of the oxygen they need to pass a law forcing Johnson to seek an extension of the UK’s EU membership. The number of Commons sitting days for that process is suddenly reduced. After a short sitting of about a week from next Tuesday, 3 September, MPs were due to return on 7 October after a three-week break for the annual party conferences. Instead, Boris will suspend parliament around 10-12 September. It will not resume until the Queen’s Speech, which will be followed by several days of debate on the measures included in it lasting until October 21-22. 
AUG28	I was an anti-abortion teenager ready to protest outside clinics – but then something huge changed my mind	I was 17 when I was asked to protest outside an abortion clinic. A friend who I attended the same all-girls Catholic convent school with wanted me to come with her to the Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing. As a way of protest, we were to stand holding hands, silently praying for all the innocent souls who’d never be born while hopefully persuading women to not commit such a “sin”. We were to be led by a boy who attended a certain all-boys school in West Brompton. 
AUG29	Ruth Davidson’s resignation is a huge blow to Boris Johnson – and a sign that his ‘one nation’ party is dead	Ruth Davidson’s resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives is very bad news for Boris Johnson. She sugared the pill a little in her valedictory statement in Edinburgh by saying she believed Johnson’s assurances to her that he genuinely wants a Brexit deal. She stressed movingly that she was also standing down for personal reasons to put her 10-month-old son before her party, but she acknowledged her “conflict” over Brexit. Davidson is one of those branded a Remainer by Brexiteers but it’s a very misleading label: she accepted the 2016 referendum result and favoured a soft Brexit to protect Scottish industry. Her well-advertised opposition to no deal does not mean she is against Brexit.
AUG29	A pro-democracy movement against Boris Johnson has been born – are you with us?	There are moments in politics when the national mood fundamentally shifts. One of those moments was yesterday – and it’s just the beginning. On the morning of 28 August Boris Johnson sent Jacob Rees-Mogg to Balmoral to tell the Queen to shut down parliament.
AUG29	This government has learned nothing from the Windrush scandal – just ask any doctor	This government’s policy to end free NHS care for all EU citizens who are not ordinarily resident in the UK after 31 October in the event of a no-deal Brexit is both discriminatory and short-sighted.

Something is not working.
AUG29	Sorry Remainers, the Queen was never going to save you from a no-deal Brexit – but your politicians can	Remainers have run out of people to hate. Yesterday, having expended their ire at the people we all elected to do politics, they directed their wrath towards our unelected head of state. On Twitter, centrist dads everywhere clutched their pearls as the Pearl-Wearer-in-Chief signed off the PM’s plans to prorogue parliament. How, they twittered, could the Queen abet the #RightWingCoup? How, after wearing that blue hat with yellow flowers, could she perform such a despicable volte-face? 
AUG29	The narrative around autism is being twisted to excuse cruelty and white male violence. We cannot let that happen	When it comes to acknowledgement and understanding of autism, we have come a long way in the past few decades. It’s easy to forget that this condition was once understood to exist only in two states, “high-functioning” and “low-functioning”, that it was predominantly diagnosed only in young, white men, and that was forgotten about once children reached 16 and entered adulthood. With a neurodiversity movement taking influence from disability rights activism and the LGBT+ rights movement, discussions have shifted towards understanding, support, acceptance and even taking pride in the condition.
AUG29	John Bercow is itching to stop Brexit – and there isn’t much the government can do to get in his way	When Charles I arrived in the chamber of the House of Commons in January 1642, armed guards in tow, to arrest a group of MPs for treason, it was the speaker who stood in his way. Instead of giving up the so-called traitors, speaker William Lenthall rebuked the King and reasserted the power of the Commons, telling Charles, “I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me.” The struggle for power between executive and legislature is not a new one. But the possibility of John Bercow taking the lead in the battle to stop Brexit offers the prospect of a modern-day stand-off, every bit as compelling as the one that took place in the months before the Civil War. It’s not Jeremy Corbyn, Yvette Cooper or Ken Clarke who’s best-placed to stop Brexit, but Bercow himself.
AUG29	Jeremy Corbyn’s reputation as an ‘extremist’ is being eclipsed by the PM’s recklessness – he should use that to his advantage	Just imagine, for a minute, the reaction had a minority government led by Jeremy Corbyn suspended parliament because, I don’t know, it was trying to nationalise the water companies but was struggling with a lack of parliamentary support for its planned course.  Picture the outrage, the Twitter storm, the newspaper headlines characterising him as a communist intent on smashing democracy, a traitor even.
AUG30	Joe Biden is going to have it tough sharing a stage with Elizabeth Warren. But this is how he could defeat her	Joe Biden remains a strong frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary race. In two weeks, however, he will face off in a debate where he will share the stage with all of the top contenders. Biden's lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average shows he's up nearly 12 points over his closest rival, Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren is just behind Sanders, with Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg a distant fourth and fifth. No other candidate is averaging higher than 2.5 per cent.
AUG30	Tulsi and Marianne need to face facts: no one wants them at the next debate	"I think the bigger problem is that the whole process really lacks transparency," said presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday’s episode of Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. One might wonder if this appearance on Tucker Carlson’s White Power Hour was actually an audition to be 2020’s Jill Stein, because nothing says spoiler quite like a Democrat going on Tucker Carlson to complain about the Democratic National Committee. The DNC made a lot of mistakes in 2016, when its unfair handling of the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders led to the resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Yet since then they’ve tried extremely hard to reform and show transparency when it comes to the debate criteria. Of course no one is obligated to agree with the DNC or the benchmarks it sets. But while DNC chair Tom Perez might be annoying, he has been completely and utterly transparent about the 2020 primary’s debate criteria. 
AUG30	What if Farage's party offered you £30k to work for him? This is what happened to me	Earlier this month I was approached to help Nigel Farage's Brexit Party with their data privacy and GDPR compliance, for which I would have been paid £30,000. Although I welcome Brexiteers taking data privacy seriously after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I turned down the contract. It is time for more conscientious objectors in the business world. Only by cutting off divisive, racist individuals from the suppliers who make their organisations function can we pressure them into either moderating their views, or disappearing into obscurity. 
AUG30	The government wants to make it easier to exclude pupils from school. This is wrong-headed	A leaked document outlining the government’s plans for schools this week suggests that schools will be given greater powers to exclude pupils. Before it publishes its plans officially we would urge the government to stop and think about the wisdom of simply consigning more children to alternative provision schools, which take those ejected from elsewhere.
AUG30	This government has learned nothing from the Windrush scandal – just ask any doctor	This government’s policy to end free NHS care for all EU citizens who are not ordinarily resident in the UK after 31 October in the event of a no-deal Brexit is both discriminatory and short-sighted.

AUG30	A Tory minister has been caught telling the truth? Don’t panic, it was only an accident	Ben Wallace was the longest-serving security minister in this country’s history. For three years he led this nation’s fight against terror in all its ever-changing technological forms. So it is a little concerning that in that time nobody got round to briefing him on what it is that a television camera and a lapel microphone actually do.
AUG30	The Amazon rainforest is burning, but it is food price profiteering that really swings the axe	The Amazon rainforest, this wonder of nature sprawling across nine countries in Latin America, holds a special place on this planet. Faced with stark climate and biodiversity crises, we cannot afford more damage to it – or to human health from the haze that hangs over communities and cities. We must help Brazil extinguish these fires and offer long-term support to prevent further illegal deforestation.
AUG30	Ruth Davidson’s resignation is a huge blow to Boris Johnson – and a sign that his ‘one nation’ party is dead	Ruth Davidson’s resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives is very bad news for Boris Johnson.

AUG31	Boris Johnson’s actions are showing his weakness – and making a no-deal Brexit unlikelier than ever	No one seems to believe the prime minister’s reasons for preventing parliament from sitting for five weeks. He says it is the normal procedure before a Queen’s speech setting out a new government’s programme, which it is not. But the fury over the misuse of the royal prerogative risks distracting from the important point. Boris Johnson’s resort to a cloak-and-dagger device confirms that he thinks the House of Commons is likely to block a no-deal Brexit. It is a sign of weakness rather than strength.
AUG31	When my tweet about 'gay genes' went viral, I realised we're looking at LGBT+ history all wrong	On Friday morning I posted a tweet which included a picture of a faded yellow cutting I took from a national newspaper in 1993.  
AUG31	Yes, I use a wheelchair, but I probably don’t want your help – able-bodied people need to stop forcing it on us	Using a wheelchair for exercise has its trials. But they don’t arise from the pushing.  I’ve written before about how annoying it is that people seem to think I’m incapable of tackling a hill, despite my going out in clothes liberally splattered with the Nike swoosh.

AUG31	After MeToo, women’s careers are still suffering because men don’t know how to avoid harassing us	Newton’s Third Law declares that “for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction”. And so it was inevitable that we would see an equal and opposite reaction to MeToo.  
AUG31	Joe Biden is going to have it tough sharing a stage with Elizabeth Warren. But this is how he could defeat her	Joe Biden remains a strong frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary race.

AUG31	As a male dancer myself, I know why Prince George was really mocked for taking ballet	Last week’s comments by ABC’s Lara Spencer mocking Prince George for enjoying ballet class rightly provoked a great deal of outrage. For me, they brought up all those memories of having to explain throughout my life why I, a boy, did ballet.

AUG31	John Major has dragged the blue-on-blue Tory Brexit war into the courts. Now the law must protect the Commons, and the people	When David Cameron unleashed the demons and called his In/Out referendum on EU membership in 2016, he was reportedly much exercised about “blue on blue” action – public rows between members of the Conservative party, and especially between cabinet members and other senior figures.  It was felt, understandably enough, that the spectacle of big-name Tories arguing among themselves would make it harder for the party to heal its wounds and reunite after the referendum was won.
AUG31	A Tory minister has been caught telling the truth? Don’t panic, it was only an accident	Ben Wallace was the longest-serving security minister in this country’s history. For three years he led this nation’s fight against terror in all its ever-changing technological forms. So it is a little concerning that in that time nobody got round to briefing him on what it is that a television camera and a lapel microphone actually do.
SEP1	Don’t be fooled, the only thing Boris Johnson wants from the northeast is permission to use Brexit to rob it blind	On top of the former Lower Tyne Colliery in Gateshead stands the Angel of the North. Her arms span some 53 metres, but her reach is far greater. In fact, she touches almost everyone in the northeast, as her creator intended. “I wanted to make an object that would be a focus of hope at a painful time of transition,” said Antony Gormley in 1998. I wonder how many look up to her today and feel that hope?
SEP1	What on Earth is going on with Dave Chappelle?	What’s going on with Dave Chappelle? This is the question I’ve been asking myself since watching his new Netflix special, Sticks & Stones, which came out on Monday. In his one-hour comedy show, Chappelle touches on a number of topics, from LGBT+ rights to MeToo and feminism. In an especially bewildering moment, he takes aim at Wade Robson and James Safechuck, the two men who laid out detailed allegations of sexual abuse against Michael Jackson in the HBO documentary Leaving Neverland. “I’m going to say something that I’m not allowed to say,” he warns the audience (although such a warning might not be necessary, because Chappelle has built a career out of saying “things he’s not allowed to say”). “But I’ve got to be real. I don’t believe these motherf*****s. I do not believe them.”

SEP1	Brexit is poisoning our politics – it needs to be resolved before we can move on	As a child my favourite pantomime was the local legend of the Lambton Worm, in which an arrogant aristocrat throws an underweight fishing catch down a well and comes back years later to find it has become a giant worm holding the entire region captive. Now that Boris Johnson is making the transition from pantomime buffoon to political despot, the extent to which David Cameron’s Brexit worm has poisoned our political well becomes distressingly clear. Arrogant Old Etonian Cameron called the referendum to sort out the internal party politics of the Conservative Party. He didn’t take it seriously, he didn’t put in place basic checks and balances, such as defining what “Leave” meant or ensuring a viable majority had to vote for such an overwhelming change to our economic and social landscape.

SEP2	Boris Johnson is a man with nothing to offer and no idea what to do. And so his words outside No 10 were entirely meaningless	If it was what he was going for then, in fairness to the prime minister, it was the best impression of David Brent that’s ever been attempted outside the front of the door of 10 Downing Street. Specifically, the most unhinged bit in the Brent narrative arc, when he imagines himself to be Lenny Henry, flashing his teeth and raising a middle finger to Dawn French, who won’t stop going on at him about putting the bins out while he’s “got to save some Africans!”
SEP2	I watched my father and brother killed by Israeli bombs. For me, the UK arms trade is deeply personal	For many people who have lived a life free from war and military occupation, the global arms trade may seem like a distant or even irrelevant issue. But for Palestinians like me, it is an inescapable and painful reality. I am a 19-year-old who has spent my entire childhood in the Gaza strip, a place sometimes described as the world's “largest open air prison”. This is because of the crippling military blockade enforced on the region by the Israeli state, which denies us access to basic rights and resources every single day.
SEP2	Indonesia’s new capital will be an environmental disaster – and yet another protected rainforest will be destroyed	Building a new capital city from scratch in a jungle-covered area with little to no infrastructure and moving nearly 1 million civil servants to the city within 5 years is definitely a mammoth and expensive undertaking. And yet, it’s what the government of Indonesia has decided to do. President Joko Widodo recently announced that the country’s capital will be relocated from Jakarta to a yet-to-be-built city in the east of Borneo island, more than 1,000km away.
SEP2	Yes, I use a wheelchair, but I probably don’t want your help – able-bodied people need to stop forcing it on us	Using a wheelchair for exercise has its trials.

SEP2	Boris Johnson's contempt for our fragile constitution is the most dangerous thing to come of Brexit	Depending on who you listen to, Boris Johnson’s has either enacted a coup this week, or simply conducted some run-of-the-mill politics. The multi-coloured lens of Brexit has a habit of polarising the view. Leavers like Johnson or his Chancellor Sajid Javid claim the prorogation of parliament is entirely normal before a new session. After an extraordinarily long two-year period, the time is ripe for a Queen’s Speech opening a new, post-Brexit parliamentary session.

SEP2	If our gangster government starts picking which laws it respects, the fight could switch to the streets	Before Dominic Cummings was forbidden from opening his trap in public he observed that politicians “don't get to choose which votes they respect”. Acerbic, clever, distorting and subtly demeaning its intended victims – typical Cummings.  No matter that the mandate of 2016 cannot be necessarily interpreted as one for a no-deal Brexit, or any other type of Brexit for that matter. Nor does Cummings mind that MPs, the common name for elected politicians, have a job to do as our representatives and we do not rule by plebiscite or orders-in-council promulgated by the Queen on the advice of her prime minister (not yet anyway).
SEP2	Pornhub wants to save the world from plastics. Unfortunately, the campaign isn't what it seems	Last week, the world's most notorious pornography outlet, Pornhub, which sees around 40 million global visitors per day, launched a pornographic film titled Dirtiest Porn Ever. Since most of us are aware that the titles of pornographic films often contain hyperbole, it begs the question: what’s made its release newsworthy? Well, the campaign behind it. The film stars popular “amateur” couple Leolulu, who have more than 151,000 followers on Instagram, engaging in some X-rated action on a beach – one of the world’s most polluted with plastic. Each time the porno is played to the end, Pornhub says it will make a donation to Ocean Polymers, a non-profit that specialises in solutions to collect and process plastic waste from the world’s oceans.
SEP2	Boris Johnson can lock the doors to the Palace of Westminster – but he can’t stop MPs meeting for a People’s Parliament	As MPs return to Westminster this week, something is happening. Not “prorogation” (yet) but the seeds of a British revolution. MPs are recognising that the House of Commons is not just a set of green benches, but a living, breathing assembly which cannot be cowed or silenced. Boris Johnson’s apparent belief that No 10 has to have confidence in the House of Commons to allow it to sit, rather than the House of Commons needing to have confidence in him to allow him to stay, is a misreading of history.

SEP3	Why we, as Labour MPs, will vote against an early election	This is the most perilous week in our country’s recent peacetime history. We have a prime minister prepared to pursue a no-deal Brexit that wasn’t even contemplated by the Leave campaign he led during the 2016 EU referendum. In fact, the Leave campaign said securing a deal with the EU would be one of the easiest in history.  In order to prevent this, parliament is prepared to vote for, and pass legislation to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. In retaliation, the prime minister is prepared to push for a general election if the legislation is passed. 
SEP3	I've researched how a no-deal Brexit will affect our economy. This is the answer — for now and decades in the future	Predictions about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit have ranged from the apocalyptic to “no big deal.” Indeed, some fringe economists have even suggested that no deal would boost the UK economy. And while no credible analysis supports this view, there is huge uncertainty – particularly in the short term. But that doesn’t mean that economics has nothing useful to say, or that there isn’t consensus among credible economists about the likely consequences. As our report on the impacts and implications of no deal shows, the imposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers between the UK and its largest trading partner will be a major shock to the UK economy.
SEP3	Suicide rates match a spike in anti-depressants. Look to austerity for the cause not lifestyle ‘choices’	Perhaps the greatest achievement of our time is the gains made in life expectancy. We are living much longer than our Victorian counterparts who were lucky to see their forties. Double that life span is now the norm. But this advance is not shared by all parts of the population.  There are marked differences in life expectancy based on where you live. Residents of Hartlepool will die nearly a decade before those in Camden. This is clearly an unjust situation but a trend that has continued for years.
SEP3	I watched my father and brother killed by Israeli bombs. For me, the UK arms trade is deeply personal	For many people who have lived a life free from war and military occupation, the global arms trade may seem like a distant or even irrelevant issue. But for Palestinians like me, it is an inescapable and painful reality. I am a 19-year-old who has spent my entire childhood in the Gaza strip, a place sometimes described as the world's “largest open air prison”. This is because of the crippling military blockade enforced on the region by the Israeli state, which denies us access to basic rights and resources every single day.
SEP3	This week's spending review will echo the cynical political budgets we thought were a thing of the past	There are three things to bear in mind about the (scheduled – anything can happen these strange days) spending review. The first is that it hardly lives up to the name. Spending reviews are supposed to give everyone concerned – civil servants, NHS managers, generals, university vice-chancellors, local councils, headteachers – some idea of what will be happening to their budgets in the medium term. A five-year horizon is normal. 
SEP3	Indonesia’s new capital will be an environmental disaster – and yet another protected rainforest will be destroyed	Building a new capital city from scratch in a jungle-covered area with little to no infrastructure and moving nearly 1 million civil servants to the city within 5 years is definitely a mammoth and expensive undertaking. And yet, it’s what the government of Indonesia has decided to do. President Joko Widodo recently announced that the country’s capital will be relocated from Jakarta to a yet-to-be-built city in the east of Borneo island, more than 1,000km away.
SEP3	If older Americans were going to save us from gun violence, they'd have done it already. Luckily millennials are the biggest 2020 voting bloc	I’m from the first mass shooting generation. I was nine years old in 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher in the Columbine shooting. I remember the lock-down drills that followed in my elementary school; listening as my principal came over the loudspeaker reciting the name of a long-dead actor as our codeword: “Cary Grant is in the building. I repeat, Cary Grant is in the building.”  We locked the doors, huddled together and turned off the lights until the all-clear was given. These felt like fleeting moments at the time. We’d giggle under our desks, joking about having to go to the bathroom before the lock-down was over; not grasping the enormity of the situation. But, it would pass, and when the drill was over we went back to our acrostic poems, vocabulary flash cards, and basic multiplication tables. Nothing really changed after that “first” school shooting, but we kept practising the drill. 
SEP3	Corbyn will refuse a general election, so there’s only one way through this crisis – a second Brexit vote	At last. After years of disappointment, Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing, for the right reason, at the right time. He has not fallen, we’re led to believe, for what Tony Blair accurately called Boris Johnson’s “elephant trap” of an early election. He has, according to the briefings, decided to put killing off no-deal first, and an election second. This is very much a principled move, in the national interest and (for a change) it is a Labour parliamentary manoeuvre that will succeed.
SEP3	As a psychologist, I look at Boris Johnson and I worry for Britain	With Brexit looming and a snap election lurking in the background, the question everyone is asking is whether our prime minister has what it takes to lead us into unknown territory. I study the psychology of business, and from this standpoint, it is fascinating to observe politicians’ behaviour, particularly when distinguishing between effective and ineffective leadership styles. 
SEP3	Boris Johnson could have confronted crime at its core. Instead he falls back on Tory scaremongering	 “On entering … I was struck by the sight of rows of women’s faces pressed against the open observation hatches of their locked doors, peering into the narrow, dark cell block corridor.”  Do not be mistaken. These are not pre-Victorian observations of “angel of the prisons” Elizabeth Fry, social reformer and Quaker philanthropist upon a visit to Newgate Prison in the early nineteenth century. These are the 2019 comments of HMIP chief inspector Peter Clarke in his report published earlier this week, following a recent inspection of HMP Eastwood Park in Falfield, South Gloucestershire. 
SEP4	Jeremy Corbyn tonight passed up the opportunity for an early election – but just give him a few days	The most significant words tonight were uttered by Jeremy Corbyn, who was late to take his place in the chamber after MPs passed the bill to block a no-deal Brexit surprisingly quickly.  The Labour leader repeated what he had said the night before: “Let this bill pass and gain royal assent, then we will back an election so we do not crash out with a no-deal exit from the EU.”
SEP4	Yes, it is a climate crisis. And your tiny human efforts have never seemed so meagre	Talk of a climate crisis moves to the top of the agenda again, just as the burning of the Amazon forests drifts from our headlines. But are we really heading towards a collective suicide? We instinctively feel that by destroying the Amazon rainforests, Brazilians are killing “the lungs of our Earth”. However, if we want to confront seriously threats to our environment, what we should avoid are precisely such quick extrapolations which fascinate our imagination.
SEP4	The picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg lying down on the job will haunt the Tories for decades	When the tale is told of the first parliamentary vote of Boris Johnson’s premiership, it will mention his spectacular failure to win it; his removal of the whip from lifelong Conservatives including former cabinet members and Churchill’s grandson; and his loss of a majority, and potentially the forcing of a general election on a tired and bitterly divided British public. But after the immediate repercussions of this weeks’ vote are over, there will be an image from last night that hangs around Tory necks for years to come: Jacob Rees-Mogg lying horizontal on the front bench as he listened to the debate, lounging insouciantly like a rebel child defying nanny, showing all the grace of Kevin the Etonian Teenager.
SEP4	I watched my father and brother killed by Israeli bombs. For me, the UK arms trade is deeply personal	For many people who have lived a life free from war and military occupation, the global arms trade may seem like a distant or even irrelevant issue.

SEP4	This week's spending review will echo the cynical political budgets we thought were a thing of the past	There are three things to bear in mind about the (scheduled – anything can happen these strange days) spending review. The first is that it hardly lives up to the name. Spending reviews are supposed to give everyone concerned – civil servants, NHS managers, generals, university vice-chancellors, local councils, headteachers – some idea of what will be happening to their budgets in the medium term. A five-year horizon is normal. 
SEP4	Sajid Javid tried to bury austerity – but this bizarre Treasury rule stopped him going far enough	This is an electioneering budget. So money is scattered around – to garner votes for the new Brexit party from a range of constituencies: veterans, teachers, policemen, to name but a few. But in a welcome deviation from Osborne’s decade-long austerity, Sajid Javid offers the promise of a new “fiscal framework” and more investment on infrastructure. The latter must be welcomed. UK business investment as a 17 per cent share of GDP has for too long lagged behind the OECD average of 22 per cent – and explains the absence of a full recovery 12 years after the Great Financial Crisis. But there is also denial. The “decade of recovery” line after nearly 10 years of austerity was misleading. If this is “recovery” then why has Britain lagged behind her OECD partners, and why in the second quarter of this year did the economy shrink by 0.2 per cent – the worst quarter since 2012? The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) believes there is a 25 per cent chance Britain is already in “technical recession”.
SEP4	In his first PMQs, Boris Johnson's racist words had consequences – but this time they were finally for him	It was the cockney twang that did it. The wide vowels and the half-dropped Hs. The reminder, not that one was needed, that beneath his turban and behind his greying beard, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, born in Slough and now the town’s MP, is as British as they come. “Mr Speaker,” he began. “If I decide to wear a turban ... or he decides to wear a kippah or a skull cap, or she decides to wear a hijab or a burqa, does that mean it is open season for right honourable members of this house to make derogatory and divisive remarks about our appearance?” Eyes were widening. Silence swept across the benches behind the prime minister like the blast radius from a nuclear explosion.
SEP4	I fell down the rabbit hole of alt-right propaganda and this is what I learned	It's true what they say about the alt-right: it's a tiny – I mean, really tiny – group of people and its members reside largely in the gloomier recesses of the internet. So why is such a small cabal having a profoud effect on our modern political discourse? Because, as I found out myself, when something goes wrong in life, it's so incredibly easy to slip down those dark rabbit holes. 
SEP4	Dominic Cummings couldn't be happier – he is reshaping the Tories and the only cost might be the keys to No 10	Last night’s drama in the corridors of the Palace of Westminster will go down as a particularly infamous event. Not since John Major’s days has a government removed the whip from MPs over a vote on Europe, and back then they at least limited it to one. Last night, 21 men and women’s careers in the Tory party were brought to an abrupt end. But that, perhaps, wasn’t the most telling part of the evening. One anecdote doing the rounds this morning is the story of how, late on, Jeremy Corbyn was challenged by an excitable bystander in Portcullis House, who shouted at him “Come on Jeremy, let’s do this election, don’t be scared!’ 
SEP5	Boris Johnson’s only way out of this crisis is to resign	Jo Johnson’s resignation may not have much practical effect, but it is symbolic, and it dramatises his brother’s problem.  The prime minister cannot have an early election, because Labour MPs refuse to vote for it. He won’t ask for a Brexit extension, as required to do by the backbench bill that will be law by Monday. It looks as if he will have to resign. 
SEP5	If we must all sink to Boris Johnson's level, at least Ken Clarke is willing to stick the boot in on the way down	It is well known that the Conservative Party is ruthless and vicious, with a lust for getting its own way and a sociopathic disdain for what must be crushed to get it. All of which has never been more inconvenient for its current leader, who must now be wondering how wise it was to break it in two and set the other half against himself.
SEP5	X Factor is dredging up failed acts for views. Has it learned nothing from TV’s dark era of humiliation?	 We just can’t seem to get rid of it, can we? After 15 years of humouring, then later suffering, its roster of manufactured pop stars, The X Factor is back – but not as we know it. This round, for the 16th time, we’re rumoured to be getting not just one but two iterations of the increasingly insufferable show, with celebrity and all-star specials set to hit our screens later this year. 
SEP5	The picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg lying down on the job will haunt the Tories for decades	When the tale is told of the first parliamentary vote of Boris Johnson’s premiership, it will mention his spectacular failure to win it; his removal of the whip from lifelong Conservatives including former cabinet members and Churchill’s grandson; and his loss of a majority, and potentially the forcing of a general election on a tired and bitterly divided British public.

SEP5	We don't need to talk about mental health after the Texas shooting. We need to talk about toxic masculinity	After the Odessa, Texas shooter’s killing spree that left seven dead and 22 injured on Saturday, including a toddler who was shot in the face, Trump announced to White House reporters that the violence was the result of “a mental thing”, that background checks wouldn’t do anything to decrease gun violence and that the shooter was merely “another sick person”.  I paused momentarily to consider those comments. Is it possible that Americans are suffering from a special form of mental illness, unique to this country, that leads its sufferers to buy military-grade assault rifles and proceed to shoot as many people as possible everywhere from kindergartens to movie theatres to highways? 
SEP5	Suicide rates match a spike in anti-depressants. Look to austerity for the cause not lifestyle ‘choices’	Perhaps the greatest achievement of our time is the gains made in life expectancy. We are living much longer than our Victorian counterparts who were lucky to see their forties. Double that life span is now the norm. But this advance is not shared by all parts of the population.  There are marked differences in life expectancy based on where you live. Residents of Hartlepool will die nearly a decade before those in Camden. This is clearly an unjust situation but a trend that has continued for years.
SEP5	Lebanon’s crisis is almost unstoppable. Drone warfare is on the horizon	After two civil wars, multiple invasions and political assassinations galore, you might think Lebanon deserves a break from the greatest crisis since its last greatest crisis. But no – here we were this week with the Israelis claiming the Hezbollah were running a missile factory in the Bekaa Valley and the prime minister – the Lebanese one, not the Israeli – claiming that the world’s investors could put their money in his country even though this infinitely small nation has one of the world’s highest debt to GDP ratios. One-hundred-and-fifty per cent to be precise. Saad Hariri, the prime minister in question – and yes, his father was indeed assassinated by a huge car bomb a few hundred metres from my own home in Beirut – has been trying to talk down the threat of a credit-rating downgrade just as Lebanon itself declared a “state of economic emergency” on Monday. It was his high-spending billionaire father who kicked off his country’s near-bankruptcy with a massive new city centre after the civil war had destroyed much of Beirut. That is the second civil war we are talking about. It lasted 15 years and cost around 150,000 lives. The figure, by the way, creeps up to 175,000, depending on the newspapers you choose to trust.
SEP5	A new sex ed curriculum means nothing if the ignorance outside the school gates isn’t confronted first	September is a time of fresh beginnings. Going back to school after the endless summer holidays is about catching up with old friends, making new ones, showing off a new haircut and gossiping about who’s hooked up with who. And this year, thousands of children finishing their breaks are going to march through the school gates into a brand new sex and relationship education (RSE). Come September 2020, RSE will be compulsory in all primary and secondary schools, but the government is actively encouraging teachers to get the new curriculum up and running this academic year. This marks the first major reform to sex ed in eighteen years. Until now, young people have been taught the same topics as those who are now in their late thirties.
SEP5	Under Boris Johnson, it seems punishment is reserved for rebels, not racists	Rarely is Prime Minister’s Questions inspiring. Occasionally, the odd clever quip will make headlines. Yesterday, we saw Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi receive a resounding applause in the House of Commons for condemning Islamophobic comments made by the prime minister, and calling on him to apologise for the hurt and offence caused to Muslim women. Unfortunately, Dhesi was met with ambiguity and bumbling, but no apology.
SEP5	Carrie Lam has bowed to pressure from Hong Kong's protesters – but her days are numbered	After more than 13 weeks of mass demonstrations, strikes and violent confrontations, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, will finally withdraw her controversial extradition bill which was the catalyst for the widespread civil unrest. Yet the move is unlikely to make any major impact. Even the highly ineffective Lam must recognise that the activism on her streets has now extended way beyond that single issue. The original mass protests have rapidly developed into a comprehensive pro-democracy social movement, dubbed both the "hard hat revolution" and the "revolution of our times."
SEP6	Robert Mugabe brutally squandered the ‘jewel’ of Zimbabwe – his rule was a bitter lesson for South Africa	When Robert Mugabe was elected president of the newly liberated, independent Zimbabwe in 1980, his friend and long-term supporter president Julius Nyerere of Tanzania congratulated him, but added this advice: “You have inherited a jewel. Keep it that way.” Mugabe had indeed inherited a jewel, but both his nation and he himself had some fatal flaws. The former white-run, self-governing colony of Rhodesia took its name from the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and it was the last outpost of racist “European” minority rule on the continent, apart from the apartheid regime in South Africa. Despite years of civil war and UN sanctions, the country was, at least for its settler class, prosperous, with a stable economy exporting foodstuffs, tobacco and raw materials across the world.
SEP6	The single, four-year-old tweet that told us everything we were in for with Donald Trump	Long after he leaves office — for prison, Moscow, a six-month residency at Caesars Palace, wherever — the lies and tantrums that define Donald Trump's Twitter feed will keep historians and psychologists scrambling to make sense of it all. The fiasco known as Sharpiegate is just the latest example of social media amplifying his grotesque instability. But of all the filth he has foisted on the world since he first learned to stab at his phone with his tiny thumbs, one tweet in particular remains the most resonant emblem of Trump's cynicism and his recklessness. On 22 November 2015, more than a year before he turned the West Wing into a crash pad for fringe-right mediocrities, Trump re-tweeted an image expressly designed to get the shriveled hearts of white supremacists racing.
SEP6	X Factor is dredging up failed acts for views. Has it learned nothing from TV’s dark era of humiliation?	 We just can’t seem to get rid of it, can we? After 15 years of humouring, then later suffering, its roster of manufactured pop stars, The X Factor is back – but not as we know it. This round, for the 16th time, we’re rumoured to be getting not just one but two iterations of the increasingly insufferable show, with celebrity and all-star specials set to hit our screens later this year. 
SEP6	I'm an angry woman and that's just fine	I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been called an angry feminist (or some variation on the same theme). It’s happened with renewed intensity lately because I dared criticise a number of well-liked men publicly. I didn’t like Quentin Tarantino’s new film? Someone wishes I would just “suspend [my] tunnel-vision feminist views” long enough to enjoy the movie (sorry, that film is almost three hours long, can’t do it). I feel so-so about the upcoming Joker movie? Clearly, I’m delivering a “militant feminist rant” or I'm the embodiment of “toxic feminism gone too far”. I don’t enjoy Dave Chappelle’s new Netflix special? Wow, I must "think I’m so woke". It’s a natural reaction, when someone calls you something in order to discredit you, to feel defensive. What? Me? I’m not an angry feminist! Feminist, sure, but angry? I’m not angry. I’m too cool for angry. I’m too composed for angry. Angry is for children. It’s for people who can’t keep a lid on their emotions. Angry is disgraceful. Angry is bad.
SEP6	The picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg lying down on the job will haunt the Tories for decades	When the tale is told of the first parliamentary vote of Boris Johnson’s premiership, it will mention his spectacular failure to win it; his removal of the whip from lifelong Conservatives including former cabinet members and Churchill’s grandson; and his loss of a majority, and potentially the forcing of a general election on a tired and bitterly divided British public.

SEP6	Google has entered the videogaming industry. Its competitors should be terrified but instead they're in denial	As students of disruption, it never ceases to surprise us to see the same pattern repeating itself in industry after industry. When powerful incumbent firms are threatened with disruption, their first reaction tends to be denial. This is followed by derision and then by doubling the investment in existing technology.  The pattern is also true of the $131 billion videogaming industry. Microsoft’s gaming head, Phil Spencer, said that console hardware is here to stay while videogame streaming is “years and years away” from becoming mainstream.
SEP6	Forget Change UK, we need a new Tory party alternative and now is the time to form one	The moment Phillip Lee left the Tory benches in the House of Commons during the Brexit vote and sat beside Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson will be immortalised for two reasons. First, the defection was caught on camera and second, it took place as Boris Johnson was talking. Then came the departure of Johnson’s own brother and cabinet member, Jo. He has had a bad week.
SEP6	Boris Johnson's destruction of democracy is making it easier for the hard right to ruin our planet	The struggle in parliament is about far more than Brexit. It is about protecting the very heart of democracy itself from a dangerous authoritarian demagoguery that threatens the entire planet. Boris Johnson’s regime seems to be openly at war with planet earth. When Green Party MP Caroline Lucas challenged the prime minister to distance Britain from Brazilian leader Bolsonaro due to his “acceleration” of the devastating fires in the Amazon, Boris refused to rule out a trade deal with Brazil. 
SEP6	Boris Johnson’s only way out of this crisis is to resign	Jo Johnson’s resignation may not have much practical effect, but it is symbolic, and it dramatises his brother’s problem.  The prime minister cannot have an early election, because Labour MPs refuse to vote for it. He won’t ask for a Brexit extension, as required to do by the backbench bill that will be law by Monday. It looks as if he will have to resign. 
SEP7	The government won’t block the return of the world’s largest arms fair – so I’m protesting to stop it for good	Last year’s demonstrations against Donald Trump drew some of the biggest crowds seen at UK protests since the Iraq war. People were absolutely right to protest his divisive politics and his far-right bating. They are right to condemn his Mexico border wall and the detention of children. But here in the UK, and all across Europe, we have our own racist and violent borders which draw much less attention. In 2014, the Italian Navy removed its “Mare Nostrum” search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, put in place after 600 people drowned, blaming lack of financial support from other EU countries like our own (the UK has consistently refused to share responsibility for migrants arriving in Europe). 
SEP7	My father won’t get hospital treatment because he’s terrified we’ll be reported to China as Uighur Muslims	A few weeks ago, my father fell seriously ill. So ill that he stopped going to work. He urgently needed to be taken to the hospital but he refused to go. His reason for not doing so introduced me to a new fear many Uighur Muslims like ourselves are facing. My father was afraid that if any hospital staff reported our Uighur identity to the Chinese embassy, then we could be deported too.  He didn’t want our family to end up like millions of Uighurs in “concentration camps”. He insisted on treating himself with home remedies. He insisted on betting his life for our safety. It took us two weeks to make him feel better. After days of tending to him during that painful time, I stepped out and saw a group protesting, and my heart filled with anger. They were protesting in support of Kashmir. But the reasons behind the hurt I felt are more complex than you think. 
SEP7	The Top 10: Units of Measurement	This list started when Zetetic Elench found a US news report that said: “A sinkhole roughly the size of six to seven washing machines has closed the northbound lanes of State Line Road in Kansas City, Missouri.”  1. Length: London buses (nominated by Patrick Walsh).
SEP7	When you're a black Jewish American, it's hard to ignore what Netanyahu is doing in Israel	In high school, I took a class called Modern Zionism. It was a mandatory course to graduate as I went to a religious school, one that aimed to educate me on both real world skills and how to be a “good” Jew. Mixed in with Torah values, we were urged to go to Israel for a year or more, to see our “homeland”, study at religion school, and deepen our connection with God. Ninety-five per cent of my class went to study in Israel, attending expensive, exclusive gender-segregated seminaries. I did not. 
SEP7	I'm an angry woman and that's just fine	I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been called an angry feminist (or some variation on the same theme). It’s happened with renewed intensity lately because I dared criticise a number of well-liked men publicly. I didn’t like Quentin Tarantino’s new film? Someone wishes I would just “suspend [my] tunnel-vision feminist views” long enough to enjoy the movie (sorry, that film is almost three hours long, can’t do it). I feel so-so about the upcoming Joker movie? Clearly, I’m delivering a “militant feminist rant” or I'm the embodiment of “toxic feminism gone too far”. I don’t enjoy Dave Chappelle’s new Netflix special? Wow, I must "think I’m so woke". It’s a natural reaction, when someone calls you something in order to discredit you, to feel defensive. What? Me? I’m not an angry feminist! Feminist, sure, but angry? I’m not angry. I’m too cool for angry. I’m too composed for angry. Angry is for children. It’s for people who can’t keep a lid on their emotions. Angry is disgraceful. Angry is bad.
SEP7	Salvini is gone for now, but the EU needs to act fast to ensure he doesn’t come back	The birth of the new coalition government between the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party marks the end of the latest Italian political crisis – for now. It was a crisis that began when Matteo Salvini, the pugnacious leader of the League and former deputy prime minister, pulled the plug on his coalition with the Five Star Movement in the hope of triggering elections. The move backfired. Instead of Salvini’s rise to power, the Five Star and the pro-European Democratic Party opted to form a coalition to avoid an expected drubbing at the polls.
SEP7	British politics has an entitlement problem. Can we discuss Eton’s special status?	The pinned tweet on Eton College’s Twitter feed announces the launch of the “Orwell Award”, a financial aid programme “to support talented sixth formers”.  It’s been the subject of a little light trolling. 
SEP7	Why black British parents should get their youth to enter the medical cannabis industry	Just why is Sir Simon Woolley, founder of Operation Black Vote, calling for people of colour to get involved in the UK’s burgeoning medical cannabis space? Because, as he put it at an event in London this week, “If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.” Young men from a black and ethnic minority (Bame) background make up about 51 per cent of the UK’s youth prison population despite constituting just 13 per cent of the population at large.
SEP7	A no-deal Brexit is not a 'bump in the road' for the southwest – it would destroy people's livelihoods	The camera sweeps across iconic British landscapes – cliffs, beaches, ancient buildings and modern bridges. Rousing music swells in the background and Boris Johnson’s voice booms out, confident that as prime minister he can “answer the plea of the forgotten people and the left behind towns” by making Brexit happen on 31 October.  As a promotional film, it’s powerful, although I found it rather nauseating. 
SEP8	It’s my job to predict elections, but this four-party fight will mean everything is up for grabs	It looks likely that at some point between now and Christmas, though maybe only after Halloween, Britain will hold its third election in little more than four years. It would be the first time the country has gone to the polls with such frequency since the early 1970s. Our politics is evidently in an unusually febrile state – the outcome of which is even more difficult to anticipate than usual. Traditionally, British elections were dominated by two parties, the Conservatives and Labour. Only the Liberals, and more recently the Liberal Democrats, presented much in the way of a third-party challenge. Correctly forecasting the outcome of an election essentially meant working out which of the two big parties was going to be the more popular, with just an occasional glance at what the Liberal Democrats might achieve. 
SEP8	Remainers actually have nothing to fear from a general election – here’s why	On Monday, a further showdown will take place in parliament with Boris Johnson bellowing at Jeremy Corbyn that he is “frit” of a general election. In truth, the House of Commons is not scared of an election but deeply worried that if they give consent in principle, they hand a very practical power back to the prime minister: the right to determine the date of the election. There is no guarantee that it would take place before 31 October. Having lost any trust he ever enjoyed, Johnson may yet find himself imprisoned in office, with MPs insisting that he follows the law parliament is about to agree and goes to Brussels to avert no deal by requesting an extension of Article 50.
SEP8	When you're a black Jewish American, it's hard to ignore what Netanyahu is doing in Israel	In high school, I took a class called Modern Zionism. It was a mandatory course to graduate as I went to a religious school, one that aimed to educate me on both real world skills and how to be a “good” Jew. Mixed in with Torah values, we were urged to go to Israel for a year or more, to see our “homeland”, study at religion school, and deepen our connection with God. Ninety-five per cent of my class went to study in Israel, attending expensive, exclusive gender-segregated seminaries. I did not. 
SEP8	The kids are back at school, and that means flinging my child into the sweary bear-pit of London transport	The hardest thing I have ever done was letting go of my child at the top of a huge waterslide when he was three. There were other children around the same size and smaller than him cheerfully doing the same thing. I had an adult friend at the base, ready to catch him at the bottom. I had suggested that we should carry on going down the dipping and twirling shute together for a while, until he was, perhaps, 24. But my boy was insistent and so, at the top, I carefully positioned him, squeezed my eyes shut and, after some encouragement from the other parents, staff and a four-year-old girl, I loosened my grip on him and let him go. He was fine. Of course. He loved it and we did it again and again until I actually opened my eyes to watch and everyone agreed that I had been very brave. No waterpark could ever have prepared me for this week. This was the week where my curly-headed, soft-cheeked now 11-year-old child got into a school uniform for the first time. Shirt, tie and blazer down to his knees and off he went to high school on public transport ON HIS OWN. 
SEP8	I'm an angry woman and that's just fine	I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been called an angry feminist (or some variation on the same theme). It’s happened with renewed intensity lately because I dared criticise a number of well-liked men publicly. I didn’t like Quentin Tarantino’s new film? Someone wishes I would just “suspend [my] tunnel-vision feminist views” long enough to enjoy the movie (sorry, that film is almost three hours long, can’t do it). I feel so-so about the upcoming Joker movie? Clearly, I’m delivering a “militant feminist rant” or I'm the embodiment of “toxic feminism gone too far”. I don’t enjoy Dave Chappelle’s new Netflix special? Wow, I must "think I’m so woke". It’s a natural reaction, when someone calls you something in order to discredit you, to feel defensive. What? Me? I’m not an angry feminist! Feminist, sure, but angry? I’m not angry. I’m too cool for angry. I’m too composed for angry. Angry is for children. It’s for people who can’t keep a lid on their emotions. Angry is disgraceful. Angry is bad.
SEP8	My father won’t get hospital treatment because he’s terrified we’ll be reported to China as Uighur Muslims	A few weeks ago, my father fell seriously ill. So ill that he stopped going to work. He urgently needed to be taken to the hospital but he refused to go. His reason for not doing so introduced me to a new fear many Uighur Muslims like ourselves are facing. My father was afraid that if any hospital staff reported our Uighur identity to the Chinese embassy, then we could be deported too.  He didn’t want our family to end up like millions of Uighurs in “concentration camps”. He insisted on treating himself with home remedies. He insisted on betting his life for our safety. It took us two weeks to make him feel better. After days of tending to him during that painful time, I stepped out and saw a group protesting, and my heart filled with anger. They were protesting in support of Kashmir. But the reasons behind the hurt I felt are more complex than you think. 
SEP8	The government won’t block the return of the world’s largest arms fair – so I’m protesting to stop it for good	Last year’s demonstrations against Donald Trump drew some of the biggest crowds seen at UK protests since the Iraq war. People were absolutely right to protest his divisive politics and his far-right bating. They are right to condemn his Mexico border wall and the detention of children. But here in the UK, and all across Europe, we have our own racist and violent borders which draw much less attention. In 2014, the Italian Navy removed its “Mare Nostrum” search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, put in place after 600 people drowned, blaming lack of financial support from other EU countries like our own (the UK has consistently refused to share responsibility for migrants arriving in Europe). 
SEP8	Labour MPs have played cynical politics, and may pay a heavy price	Boris Johnson was “blindsided” by Labour’s refusal to support an early election, I am told. If so, he was not the only one.  At the start of this week, Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party, and all the commentators, including me, took it for granted that, if the prime minister asked for an election, Labour MPs would have to vote for it. 
SEP8	Salvini is gone for now, but the EU needs to act fast to ensure he doesn’t come back	The birth of the new coalition government between the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party marks the end of the latest Italian political crisis – for now. It was a crisis that began when Matteo Salvini, the pugnacious leader of the League and former deputy prime minister, pulled the plug on his coalition with the Five Star Movement in the hope of triggering elections. The move backfired. Instead of Salvini’s rise to power, the Five Star and the pro-European Democratic Party opted to form a coalition to avoid an expected drubbing at the polls.
SEP9	Boris Johnson’s tactics have all blown up in his face	The House of Commons has been sitting for only five days since Boris Johnson became prime minister six weeks ago – and in the last four of those days, last week and today, all the prime minister’s plans have been torn up and thrown back in his face.  He saw his opponents coming and tried to foil them. But he couldn’t suspend parliament altogether and, by restricting the number of days it could sit, he succeeded only in injecting a sense of urgency into the Conservative MPs who disagreed with his policy of getting out of the EU “come what may” at the end of October. 
SEP9	John Bercow is standing down, but only after an hour and a half of welling up at tributes to himself	Sally Bercow was sitting up in the gallery, her knuckles pressed into her teeth, gazing down upon the speaker's chair like a laser beam. Education questions were coming to an end. The speaker, John Bercow, took a sip from his water glass, and flicked a splash of its contents into his eyes.
SEP9	When I fled to the UK from Syria I didn't understand how hard it would be to finally feel safe	It has now been eight years since the Syrian security service threatened to cut off my hand but the psychological impact of that day still remains. My story is similar to many others I meet who have escaped the combination of tyranny and terrorism in Syria to seek out a new and safer life in Britain. Before coming to the UK, I was working as a journalist in Damascus but the regime is strictly opposed to anyone criticising the government. For this perceived crime I suffered hours of detention, questioning, psychological torture and threats from the various intelligence services operating under Bashar al Assad.
SEP9	Grief is heart-shattering enough – but the theatre of social media has made it unbearable	One smog-choked summer’s afternoon in Cairo, my mother popped up on Skype and sent me a string of messages. It was only weird because at that point she had been dead for seven years. The muscle-memory of the mind kicked in as I instinctively reached out to reply. Then a tidal wave of grief came crashing through my window. 
SEP9	When you're a black Jewish American, it's hard to ignore what Netanyahu is doing in Israel	In high school, I took a class called Modern Zionism. It was a mandatory course to graduate as I went to a religious school, one that aimed to educate me on both real world skills and how to be a “good” Jew. Mixed in with Torah values, we were urged to go to Israel for a year or more, to see our “homeland”, study at religion school, and deepen our connection with God. Ninety-five per cent of my class went to study in Israel, attending expensive, exclusive gender-segregated seminaries. I did not. 
SEP9	The chancellor has not done enough to give the right care to cancer patients	The additional investment provided by the chancellor for health and social care services this week is much-needed. However, it still falls drastically short of what is truly required to improve services for the patients, families and professionals who are being let down by a system that is teetering on the edge of collapse.  The number of people with cancer is growing and NHS cancer and social care services are facing unprecedented pressure. Despite their best efforts, hard-working professionals are struggling to keep pace with demand as there’s just not enough staff with the right skills and resources to give cancer patients the personalised care they need. A patch-and-mend approach to funding is woefully insufficient to resolve this issue.  
SEP9	It’s my job to predict elections, but this four-party fight will mean everything is up for grabs	It looks likely that at some point between now and Christmas, though maybe only after Halloween, Britain will hold its third election in little more than four years. It would be the first time the country has gone to the polls with such frequency since the early 1970s. Our politics is evidently in an unusually febrile state – the outcome of which is even more difficult to anticipate than usual. Traditionally, British elections were dominated by two parties, the Conservatives and Labour. Only the Liberals, and more recently the Liberal Democrats, presented much in the way of a third-party challenge. Correctly forecasting the outcome of an election essentially meant working out which of the two big parties was going to be the more popular, with just an occasional glance at what the Liberal Democrats might achieve. 
SEP9	Labour MPs have played cynical politics, and may pay a heavy price	Boris Johnson was “blindsided” by Labour’s refusal to support an early election, I am told. If so, he was not the only one.  At the start of this week, Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party, and all the commentators, including me, took it for granted that, if the prime minister asked for an election, Labour MPs would have to vote for it. 
SEP9	Remainers actually have nothing to fear from a general election – here’s why	On Monday, a further showdown will take place in parliament with Boris Johnson bellowing at Jeremy Corbyn that he is “frit” of a general election. In truth, the House of Commons is not scared of an election but deeply worried that if they give consent in principle, they hand a very practical power back to the prime minister: the right to determine the date of the election. There is no guarantee that it would take place before 31 October. Having lost any trust he ever enjoyed, Johnson may yet find himself imprisoned in office, with MPs insisting that he follows the law parliament is about to agree and goes to Brussels to avert no deal by requesting an extension of Article 50.
SEP9	My father won’t get hospital treatment because he’s terrified we’ll be reported to China as Uighur Muslims	A few weeks ago, my father fell seriously ill. So ill that he stopped going to work.

SEP10	This ‘humble address’ from Dominic Grieve could show whether Boris Johnson lied to the Queen	Parliament may have been told to clear off for five weeks, but some of its final actions before the dismissal of the Commons will be continue to embarrass the government – and worse.  Using an arcane but powerful bit of parliamentary machinery called a “humble address”, MPs request the Queen to tell her ministers to do certain things. It was used successfully last year to discover the full legal advice on the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, and later to have the Treasury's economic forecasts published openly.
SEP10	The UK is dangerously close to having a full-blown opioid crisis	Melissa* has lived with anxiety for as long as she can remember. As a child, it prevented her from making friends as she preferred to stay at home. As she grew older, it became worse, framing her as aloof and detached. Aged 20, she fell and fractured her knee badly. Four operations later, the pain hadn’t subsided so her doctor prescribed her tramadol, an opioid pain medication.  Opioids work by attaching to receptors across the body. They block pain messages sent from the source of the pain through the spinal cord to the brain whilst also creating feelings of well-being and euphoria. The tramadol didn’t just help ease Melissa’s knee pain in the short term, for the first time it lifted her out of the fog of anxiety. In her own words, “It made me feel beautiful.” As her tolerance increased, Melissa started seeking out more tramadol. She lied to her doctor that she’d lost her prescription, she bought more from online pharmacies as well as from a drug dealer. She went from taking eight tablets a day to 90. She stopped eating and lost four stone in weight, “I didn’t care about my life much, I just wanted to feel calm.” In my work for drug treatment charity Addaction, Melissa’s story is becoming more and more common.

SEP10	The August jobs report shows how badly Trump has let down the people he promised to help	The American economy is slowing – and Trump should be worried. America’s August jobs report is in, and it isn’t the rosy picture President Donald Trump hoped. For Trump, the news worsens an already precarious electoral situation.
SEP10	What should we do with a prorogued parliament? Ask Gary Neville	In case you hadn’t noticed, there’s a large publicly owned meeting place in a desirable part of London currently not being used for anything.  It is of course, the Palace of Westminster, which used to house Britain’s legislature until it was unceremoniously and unconstitutionally shut down by our unelected prime minister. 
SEP10	The Labour and Tory parties are dead. For politically homeless centrists, that might be a good thing	British politics is being reconfigured – if there were any doubt about this, just look at what has happened in the Conservative Party this last week. It is a party that is unrecognisable from only five years ago – it is now essentially a new party. What on earth is going on? Is it simply that both parties have been hijacked by two characters with a particular right wing nationalist and hard-left following? Or is something deeper going on?
SEP10	John Bercow is standing down, but only after an hour and a half of welling up at tributes to himself	Sally Bercow was sitting up in the gallery, her knuckles pressed into her teeth, gazing down upon the speaker's chair like a laser beam. Education questions were coming to an end. The speaker, John Bercow, took a sip from his water glass, and flicked a splash of its contents into his eyes.
SEP10	Bercow's bombshell has skewed the Brexit game and dealt Boris Johnson a bloody nose	After his emotional, amusing and typically Bercovian valedictory performance – including an especially flamboyant tie by Van Buck of England – the opposition benches rose to give John Bercow a standing ovation.  Unsurprisingly the great majority of those who found themselves on the Conservative benches did not follow suit. They sat on their hands, on the whole, and notwithstanding a slightly saccharine exchange of mutual admiration between Speaker Bercow and Michael Gove, the frostiness was understandable. 
SEP11	Pity the Labour Party. As it doubled down on Brexit lunacy, actual news robbed it of a vote-winning triumph	All polling ever done on the subject indicates that the vast majority of the public have no idea what the Labour Party’s position on Brexit is, and frankly it’s time the people started to take some responsibility for themselves. It’s easy, this stuff. All you need is to be free at 10am on a Wednesday morning, and settle yourself down in front of a TV and a laptop or a phone, so you can simultaneously watch two speeches from two of Labour’s most senior politicians, setting out entirely different policies, then choose which one you want to believe.
SEP11	In the Democratic debate this week, expect Biden to come under attack — but not by Liz Warren or Bernie	It looks like this week’s Democratic debate will be another uncomfortable night for former VP Joe Biden and an opportunity for the rest of the candidates, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), to shine. With the 10 highest polling candidates onstage (out of 20 still technically in the running), the third, one-night-only debate will also provide a chance for one of the other Democratic hopefuls to step firmly into fourth place. Fourth place is important, because it means becoming a potential vice-president on the ticket alongside the next Democratic presidential nominee. 
SEP11	Salvini is down, but the Italian hard right isn't out for the count just yet	Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s League party and former interior minister, has bad news piling up on him. Things have gone from bad to worse since he brought down his own government in an attempt to force new elections. It became immediately clear that the president of the republic, Sergio Mattarella, was not willing to facilitate Salvini’s election plan. Instead, he encouraged coalition talks between unlikely allies – the Five Star Movement, which had been in government with the League, the Democratic Party and the tiny Free and Equal party. All went unexpectedly smoothly and this new government is up and running, having secured the confidence of parliament.
SEP11	Please don't ruin the day John Bolton got fired by trying to convince me his 'dissenting voice' was necessary in the White House	Adieu, John Bolton, you won’t be missed. And, a lot of folks will probably be sleeping better tonight in your absence. Bolton made it longer than some in Donald Trump's administration, which is commendable in the same kind of way that sticking it out in the boardroom of Philip Morris probably brought some prestige at some point. With nearly a year and a half under his belt in that bizarre hall of mirrors, he’s surely up for his own book deal on whatever the hell it was he experienced while in there, and maybe a headline gig at a conservative news outlet too.
SEP11	Pete Buttigieg has called climate change a religious crisis — but is he brave enough to do it in evangelical Texas?	At the recent CNN town hall on climate disruption, the big-screen backdrop behind the hosts and the candidates did not read “Climate Change,” it read “Climate Crisis.” And at least three of those who spoke — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg — characterized this crisis as a moral crisis. Buttigieg, however, went a step further and turned the moral crisis into a religious crisis.  “Let’s talk in language,” he began, “that is understood across the heartland, about faith. You know, if you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it, countries put at risk in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that?” His answer: God would call it “a sin.”

SEP11	Putin has warned of an arms race in space – and we should all be worried	Last week Vladimir Putin suggested that a new arms race might be developing between Russia and the United States – one that could spread into outer space. Putin’s comments, made at the Eastern Economic Forum, are just the latest indication that we are entering a new phase in the global space race. The launch of Donald Trump's US Space Command followed a campaign promise in 2018, but the French declaration that it will develop anti-satellite laser weapons took the international space community by complete surprise, marking a notable change in policy.
SEP11	Tom Watson knows Boris Johnson might be forced to call a referendum – Labour’s Brexit fudge can’t last	Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has finally come out and said he no longer respects the result of the 2016 referendum. “There eventually comes a point,” he said in his speech today, “when circumstances are so changed … you have to say, actually, no, that years-old plebiscite is no longer a valid basis on which to take such a momentous decision.” Full marks for intellectual clarity.
SEP11	From India to China, the world's Muslims are being put into concentration camps	There’s a little test that you can do on the internet to prove whether you are an Indian citizen or not, based on the National Register of Citizens, being applied by law in the state of Assam.  You will most likely fail. The test does not allow the usual privileges of being born in India to parents born in India, plus simple paperwork. “None of the above” is the usual answer for form fillers. Because how else do you make life as difficult as possible for those whom you want to segregate and crush, except with impossible rules and arcane paperwork?
SEP11	These are the five most likely routes to a new Brexit referendum	Conventional wisdom has it that there’s going to be an election in November – and there’s now no chance of a Final Say referendum. But when it comes to Brexit, conventional wisdom is often wrong. In fact, there are at least five ways to get such a people’s vote, and only one involves having an election first.  Boris Johnson may now look like he has a good chance to win an election. If the opposition forces are divided, he could get an overall majority with as little as a third of the vote. 
SEP12	While Bernie and Biden fought, Elizabeth Warren shone — and Julian Castro made an obvious bid for VP	The third Democratic debate started and ended with Julian Castro. “I worked under President Obama too!” the former secretary of housing and urban development reminded the crowd, when Joe Biden got a little too carried away with his own record under the popular former Democratic president; later, he made the charge that “Biden wants to take credit for the good things Obama did” while ignoring the bad. 
SEP12	If a no-deal Brexit will cause water shortages and the return of the black market, panic is a rational response	Ah. So that’s what Michael Gove meant by “bumps in the road” after no-deal Brexit. Food prices up. Electricity up. Lorries stuck in the channel ports for days on end. Riots. A “low” threat to running water. Immigration checks at Calais or Paris or European airports. Gibraltar blockaded virtually. Low income groups – that's the poor – hit hardest. Cod wars. Social care collapsing. Shortages of medicines. And the return of the black market! The 21st century spiv may be the abiding legacy of this short tragic Johnson government. It’s difficult to know what to make of all this. The most offensive part, for me, is the blatant deception. It doesn’t feel right to have been lied to by our leaders. “Bumps in the road” sounded like a kind of tranquilliser for the anxious punters: a charming, cosy euphemism, as if we were all going on a jolly excursion to the countryside. (The irony being, of course, that all those truckers and holidaymakers won’t be going on any roads, bumpy or otherwise, once they meet French customs.)
SEP12	Salvini is down, but the Italian hard right isn't out for the count just yet	Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s League party and former interior minister, has bad news piling up on him.

SEP12	We can’t tackle class discrimination in the UK when most of us can barely define it	The TUC has called for legal measures to tackle discrimination based on class at work. They have stated that they do not wish to “ignite a lengthy debate about class”. I agree that we need to tackle the persistent class inequality in our country, but we have to find a definition in law of what class is. Otherwise no law can be passed. My family of five went up in the world when we went from an overcrowded 1 bedroom flat in post-war London, to a council house. We had no car. My father taught in a secondary modern school and then a comprehensive. My mother had worked in the Post Office before having children. I was educated in state schools, the last being an excellent grammar school from where I went to medical school. As a junior hospital doctor I worked 110 hours a week, with no absolute entitlement to time off, the caveat in the contract being “if the needs of patients allow”. My hourly rate of pay was less than the advertised rate for a night cleaner. I knew that the Labour Party would not describe me as working class. 
SEP12	Suicide among young women and girls is at the highest ever level – and Brexit is overshadowing the crisis	With Brexit and the current political turmoil dominating the headlines, far too little attention has been paid to new figures showing that suicide has risen after a five-year downward trend. The numbers released last week by the Office for National Statistics paint a worrying picture. Every life lost is a tragedy with devastating consequences.
SEP12	If I prescribe sleeping tablets to 25 people, one of them will die. Could you live with that?	The latest research on sleeping tablets has revealed that people who take them them are 3.5 times more likely to die than those who do not. That means that for every 25 people taking them, there is a death every seven years.  As I GP, I can put it more simply: if I prescribe sleeping tablets to 25 people, one of them will die. Among doctors this is known as the "number needed to kill". 
SEP12	While the Tories are playing Anarchy in the UK, why can’t Labour stop going out of tune?	This is becoming joyfully unpredictable. Ministers, when asked if they’ll comply with laws, about bringing back parliament or applying for an extension to the EU, say, “We’ll have to see.” What a fascinating turn, that a Conservative government has opted for an anarchist system where you only obey the laws you fancy.
SEP12	Residents local to Grenfell have been ignored by Kensington for years – here’s why I’m putting a stop to it	There are huge disparities in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea between the wealthy and those whose lives are affected by deprivation. The close proximity of extreme wealth and poverty is startling. However, the sense of community in the borough remains strong.  Few Kensington residents found themselves unmoved by the devastating sight of Grenfell Tower burning on the night of 14 June 2017, claiming so many lives and displacing families. Regardless of income or background, the magnitude of the Grenfell tragedy brought people together.
SEP12	Michael Gove’s hamfisted attempts to spin the Yellowhammer Brexit plan are a disgrace	When the Yellowhammer document assessing the effect of leaving the EU without a deal was leaked to The Sunday Times last month, Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning, dismissed it as an “old document”. It turned out to have been 16 days old, drawn up eight days after he and Boris Johnson took office. 
SEP13	John Bercow comes out swinging for Boris Johnson, and delivers a knockout blow	One of the reasons the word “bully” tends to hang in the air around John Bercow is that a) One of his former clerks once took time off work suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and b) he – allegedly – then took this opportunity to have her painted out of an official portrait of the speaker’s staff. That, in the court of public opinion, is what has been declared to be “punching down”. But here’s a suggestion. What if he’s not just a puncher downer? What if he’s a puncher in every single direction he can manage? Up, down, sideways, back to front, any which way but loose.
SEP13	I went on Celebrity Masterchef and I’m a Celebrity for the money. As the sole breadwinner there is no shame in that	I’m often taken aback at how comfortable some people are to talk about money and ask directly how much you earn.  I’m more likely to ask someone what kind of porn they like to watch than to stick my nose into their financial affairs. (Type that into Pornhub’s search engine, I bet you’ll find it’s somebody’s kink.)
SEP13	I thought about my time as a soldier when I heard the Supreme Court's asylum decision this week	Late Wednesday night, the Supreme Court released an order essentially allowing the Trump administration to bar most Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the United States while the relevant court cases are being considered. I've been processing this news for the past day or so, and I keep coming back to the same thing. It's all I can think about, really.
SEP13	The UK Supreme Court will not only decide Johnson’s fate, it will declare whether Scotland’s constitutional tradition still matters	The Supreme Court will be asked to decide on Tuesday whether the prime minister’s prorogation of Parliament was legal. Its decision will have fundamental implications not just for the powers of the prime minister over parliament, but on how much Scotland’s distinctive constitutional history matters to the UK’s constitution. The Scottish Court of Session, unlike the High Courts of Northern Ireland, and of England and Wales, took the view that the prorogation was a legal matter and not just a political question. The courts have jurisdiction to intervene when a prime minister’s actions are motivated by an improper purpose. In this case, the evidence showed that prorogation was an attempt to stymie the proper scrutiny of the executive by parliament.  That, it concluded, was unlawful, and within the powers of the court to prevent.

SEP13	Detention is one of the most dangerous places for LGBT+ refugees. The government must enforce a time limit	“I would have preferred to take my own life than being in there.” These are the words of Mukasa*, a gay man from Uganda, describing his experience of being held in an immigration detention centre. He’s not alone in feeling this way.

Social care collapsing. Shortages of medicines. And the return of the black market! The 21st century spiv may be the abiding legacy of this short tragic Johnson government. It’s difficult to know what to make of all this. The most offensive part, for me, is the blatant deception. It doesn’t feel right to have been lied to by our leaders. “Bumps in the road” sounded like a kind of tranquilliser for the anxious punters: a charming, cosy euphemism, as if we were all going on a jolly excursion to the countryside. (The irony being, of course, that all those truckers and holidaymakers won’t be going on any roads, bumpy or otherwise, once they meet French customs.)
SEP13	If I prescribe sleeping tablets to 25 people, one of them will die. Could you live with that?	The latest research on sleeping tablets has revealed that people who take them them are 3.5 times more likely to die than those who do not. That means that for every 25 people taking them, there is a death every seven years.  As I GP, I can put it more simply: if I prescribe sleeping tablets to 25 people, one of them will die. Among doctors this is known as the "number needed to kill". 
SEP14	As a Syrian refugee, I am appalled by the whitewashed history tours going on in my country	I woke up a few days ago to Twitter selfies of westerners posing in Syrian government-controlled areas. Being an exiled Syrian for five years now, I try to avoid pictures of my home country. The country that kicked me out when I was 18 for daring to question why our government was killing peaceful protesters. I had to choose between inescapable detention and torture or being displaced, alone, in Syria’s neighbouring countries, Lebanon and Turkey. I chose the latter.  Today we witness the new era of the Syrian war: the attempt to normalise the Syrian regime turning a blind eye to its war crimes over the years. The usually paranoid Syrian state is allowing a select group of people inside its territories to whitewash its authoritarian record.
SEP14	This is how teachers can support their pupils and mobilise for action in the climate strikes	On 20 September students across the world will return to the streets to continue to protest against climate change. This time, they have called upon adults to join them for what they hope will be the world’s biggest climate mobilisation. Since the UK strikes begun last autumn, there has been much discussion of the appropriate response from educators. Many have expressed whole-hearted enthusiasm for the students’ protests, because as a generation we have overwhelmingly failed to prevent the climate catastrophe and so many of us, like myself, are delighted to see young people leading the way. Hopefully they will succeed where we have not.
SEP14	The Top 10: Jobs held by former prime ministers	This list was suggested by Will Cooling when David Cameron was reported last November to have said (he denied it) he wanted to come back as foreign secretary. “I too am at that stage of a book where I would rather be foreign secretary,” commented Stephanie Merritt. 1. Chief ranger and keeper of Hyde Park and St James’s Park. Duke of Wellington, prime minister 1834. “And he remained commander-in-chief,” said Graham Kirby.
SEP14	I thought about my time as a soldier when I heard the Supreme Court's asylum decision this week	Late Wednesday night, the Supreme Court released an order essentially allowing the Trump administration to bar most Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the United States while the relevant court cases are being considered. I've been processing this news for the past day or so, and I keep coming back to the same thing. It's all I can think about, really.
SEP14	We can’t tackle class discrimination in the UK when most of us can barely define it	The TUC has called for legal measures to tackle discrimination based on class at work. They have stated that they do not wish to “ignite a lengthy debate about class”. I agree that we need to tackle the persistent class inequality in our country, but we have to find a definition in law of what class is. Otherwise no law can be passed. My family of five went up in the world when we went from an overcrowded 1 bedroom flat in post-war London, to a council house. We had no car. My father taught in a secondary modern school and then a comprehensive. My mother had worked in the Post Office before having children. I was educated in state schools, the last being an excellent grammar school from where I went to medical school. As a junior hospital doctor I worked 110 hours a week, with no absolute entitlement to time off, the caveat in the contract being “if the needs of patients allow”. My hourly rate of pay was less than the advertised rate for a night cleaner. I knew that the Labour Party would not describe me as working class. 
SEP14	Andrew Yang is the candidate you should watch at the next Democratic debate — and the YangGang want you to know	You’ve probably heard already that the ones to watch in this week’s Democratic debate are Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. They’re the frontrunners, after all. There is still a low hum of interest in candidates like Pete Buttigieg (the South Bend mayor responsible for more than one person in Brooklyn walking round in a T-shirt saying “BOOT-EDGE-EDGE”); Beto O’Rourke (who was “born to be in it”, then sorry that he said he was born to be in it); Amy Klobuchar (who famously ate a salad with a comb); Cory Booker (a real-life vegan and animal welfare activist, which upsets some people); and Julian Castro (whose solid debate performances and principled emphasis on immigration have kept him afloat in the polls.) But then there’s Andrew Yang. Who the hell even is Andrew Yang? Just kidding — I know you know who Andrew Yang is. He’s the one with the #YangGang and almost 800,000 Twitter followers. He’s the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wants to give out free money to anyone who’ll listen. He’s the candidate who tweeted earlier today: “For those wondering I will be crowdsurfing in sandals at Thursday’s debate” (prompting 12,390 engagements.)
SEP14	Margaret Atwood’s work illustrates our need to enjoy other people’s pain	A well-crafted worldwide publicity campaign is raising expectations for The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her Handmaid’s Tale. This, perhaps, is the right moment to take a deeper look into the reasons of our fascination with the dark world of the Republic of Gilead. Since Gilead is run by Christian fundamentalists, the best way to begin is with theology.
SEP14	I went on Celebrity Masterchef and I’m a Celebrity for the money. As the sole breadwinner there is no shame in that	I’m often taken aback at how comfortable some people are to talk about money and ask directly how much you earn.  I’m more likely to ask someone what kind of porn they like to watch than to stick my nose into their financial affairs. (Type that into Pornhub’s search engine, I bet you’ll find it’s somebody’s kink.)
SEP14	Thanks to Donald Trump, Texas is about to become a Democratic stronghold	 Ask a millennial to name a state that exemplifies the typical Republican voter and there’s a strong likelihood they’ll tell you Texas. Now a recent spate of House Republican resignations and optimistic polling has the Democratic Party ready for an all-out electoral assault.

SEP15	The oil drone attack shows how Saudi Arabia and the UAE are fighting their own battles in Yemen	The marriage between Saudi Arabia and the UAE has long been on solid ground, but like any marriage, issues develop over time.  From day one in Yemen, the two sides have had completely different agendas.
SEP15	David Cameron failed because he stuck to what he believed in	David Cameron was always an open book. As prime minister he was talkative and straightforward. Many times, I am told, when there was a Downing Street meeting to discuss a leak inquiry there would be an embarrassed shuffle from the prime minister. “Actually”, he would say, “that might have been me – I was sitting next to so-and-so at dinner…” That means there is little new in his memoir, For the Record – certainly not in the extracts published so far. He didn’t like the way Michael Gove and Boris Johnson fought the EU referendum campaign against him. He is proud of legislating for gay marriage. He thinks it was right to save the people of Benghazi from being massacred by Gaddafi.

SEP15	The Democratic debate finally has WWE sponsorship — here are your favourite candidate stage names and signature moves	Tonight’s episode of the Democratic primary show, will feature the third debate, live from Houston. Since American news organizations serve ratings and advertisers before the electorate, ABC News has outsourced debate production to WWE. Keen to showcase their storytelling for a new audience, WWE writers want to promote every candidate with a stage name, entrance music, catchphrase and finishing move. The entrance music is largely to avoid candidate Ben Carson-ing (i.e. missing their cue to go on stage).  Here’s a preview of what to expect:

SEP15	Green activists need to give nuclear energy a chance if they really want to tackle CO2 emissions	Last month, a report by Germany’s Green party concluded that 18 nuclear power plants in the European Union are operating without having been subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The conclusions were meant to suggest that the EU’s NPPs are unsafe. However, not only is an EIA a legal requirement that is only required in certain circumstances, it is entirely unrelated to safety. To address safety considerations, there are bespoke EU stress tests along with national appraisals. However, headline-grabbing news – like the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) recent ruling that a 2015 decision to extend the life of two Belgian nuclear power plants by 10 more years was unlawful because Brussels failed to conduct EIAs – effectively serves to undermine popular support of nuclear power.
SEP15	Donald Trump’s panic about vaping is a massive distraction from guns and politics	Wake up America! Vaping’s coming after your youth.  So says Donald Trump, whose wife Melania is passionate about the issue. 
SEP15	While Bernie and Biden fought, Elizabeth Warren shone — and Julian Castro made an obvious bid for VP	The third Democratic debate started and ended with Julian Castro. “I worked under President Obama too!” the former secretary of housing and urban development reminded the crowd, when Joe Biden got a little too carried away with his own record under the popular former Democratic president; later, he made the charge that “Biden wants to take credit for the good things Obama did” while ignoring the bad.

SEP16	Trump tries to talk tough, but Iran's Revolutionary Guards are running rings round him	Mr Fire and Fury is back – and this time, he says, he’s locked and loaded.  On Sunday, Donald Trump used his favourite pulpit, Twitter, to respond to the previous day’s drone and missile attacks on two Saudi oil installations, more than halving the kingdom’s production. His words implied that whoever was responsible might soon have hell to pay, and with his own secretary of state singling out Iran for the attacks, it was clear who Trump was referring to.
SEP16	As automation swallows the world of work, will we restrain the robots to protect the dignity of labour?	What is the point of economic activity? Well, the most obvious reason people start and run companies or work for them is to make a living. But there are other, subtler reasons we trade effort and time for money. It gives us a sense of purpose, achievement, independence, and our jobs are often a big part of our identity.  Could we not derive those benefits from a challenging hobby – mountain climbing maybe? To an extent. But to quote Virginia Woolf, money dignifies what is frivolous if unpaid for. Of course, there is also purpose and dignity in staying at home to take care of children or elderly parents, or in volunteering – and I hope no one would call those activities frivolous.
SEP16	Sex and scoliosis: A conversation on disability and intimacy is long overdue	Despite one in five people in the UK identifying as disabled (having a longstanding illness, disability or impairment that causes significant challenges to activities of daily life) – it is virtually impossible to access information on how to navigate disability, sex and relationships. Inspired by Brook’s theme for sexual health awareness week – sex and disability – I decided to chat to others living with scoliosis (a curvature of the spine). I was 14 when I underwent spinal surgery for scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) – I had metal Harrington rods inserted in my body, my right rib removed for bone grafting and had to have a back brace for a year. Aside from chronic back pain and a slight leg length discrepancy (I wear a foot raise in all my right shoes) my condition is entirely hidden. It meant significant changes to my mobility, acquiring new scars and altered the way I navigate relationships, yet it was something I was ill-prepared for. So, with so many people living with disability, why is this not something that we discuss more?

SEP16	Random acts of madness: all the things that Dominic Cummings is getting wrong about game theory	It has been reported by sources close to Downing Street that the prime minister’s advisor, Dominic Cummings, is a fan of game theory. And so the speculation is that he is applying some of its main principles and insights to inform the actions taken – and strategies adopted – by Boris Johnson as the country jolts and lurches towards Brexit. But is Cummings “playing the game” correctly?  One fundamental principle of game theory is that you know what the game is in the first place. You must know who the players are, what their objectives are, and the potential actions they have at their disposal.
SEP16	A written constitution might be a good idea – but it won’t save us from the idiots	Could a written constitution save us from the worst instincts of a gangster government? As the double headed monster that is Dominic Cummings/Boris Johnson torches Britain’s unwritten one, the prospect is being raised seriously by serious people. It’s nice to see we still have a few of them in a Britain whose prime minister compares himself to a bright green Marvel Comics character. 
SEP16	The oil drone attack shows how Saudi Arabia and the UAE are fighting their own battles in Yemen	The marriage between Saudi Arabia and the UAE has long been on solid ground, but like any marriage, issues develop over time.  From day one in Yemen, the two sides have had completely different agendas.
SEP16	As co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, I’m appalled by the police’s treatment of Heathrow drone protesters	Last summer, I went on hunger strike with Extinction Rebellion co-founder Roger Hallam and others for two weeks to protest the expansion of Heathrow airport; hardly anyone noticed us. We told MPs Nuremberg principles could apply in future, that expanding carbon-heavy infrastructure, knowing what we do about the scientific prognosis, is now a crime against humanity. A crime against our own children. I’m not surprised Hallam wants to try other methods to bring attention to this element of our governments suicidal policies.
SEP17	Six things we learnt from Jo Swinson’s conference speech	She stuck closely to her text, but read it fluently from the prompter. She comes across better from the platform than in interviews, where she often seems indignant and too eager to contradict her interviewer. The speech was well written, with a few jokes and some good lines. She said of Boris Johnson: “He claims he can negotiate a Brexit deal in a month. I wouldn’t hold out much hope; yesterday he failed to negotiate where to have a press conference.”
SEP17	The drone attack on the Saudi refinery is no game-changer. But is there a new ‘axis of evil’ in the Middle East?	When, a couple of days ago, Saudi Aramco’s crude-oil processing facilities were attacked with drones – it is thought by the Houthis in Yemen – our media repeatedly characterised this event as a “game-changer”. But was it really this? In some sense yes, since it perturbed the global oil supply and made a large armed conflict in the Middle East much more probable. However, one should be careful not to miss the cruel irony of this claim. Houthi rebels in Yemen have been in an open war with Saudi Arabia for years, with Saudi armed forces (and the US and the UK supplying arms) practically destroying the entire country, indiscriminately bombing civilian objects. The Saudi intervention has led to one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes of the century with tens of thousands of children dead. As it was in the cases of Libya and Syria, destroying an entire country is obviously not a game-changer – just part and parcel of a very normal geopolitical game.
SEP17	‘Don’t feed the trolls’ says a group of crusading celebrities. They should try practicing what they preach	One evening in 1993, back in the Neolithic age of digital communications, a character called Mr Bungle logged on to the text-based roleplay community LambdaMOO. Over an hour or so of frenzied verbiage, he graphically described numerous acts of physical and sexual violence he was inflicting upon the other players within the virtual world. The journalist Julian Hibbert would later describe how this one-off incident profoundly affected the users of this early precursor of a social media community. The utopian idealists of a new digital frontier were deeply shaken, suddenly left feeling unsafe, vulnerable and disillusioned in what had previously been an online safe haven. There have been trolls on the internet for as long as there has been an internet. For almost as long, the instruction “Do not feed the trolls” has furnished the code of conduct for users of forums, message boards and social media sites.  
SEP17	Italy is braced for a fascist-style fightback from a humiliated Salvini	When a new coalition was established in Italy recently, it followed a political crisis set in motion during late summer by the far-right League. The surprising outcome saw the (now former) interior minister and deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini pushed out of power. He spent this weekend gathering his forces for battles to come. Italy now has a more progressive coalition in place, including the moderate centre-leftist Democratic Party, and has replaced the most xenophobic cabinet seen in the peninsula since antisemitic laws were implemented in 1938 by the fascist dictatorship. The country is currently rebuilding its traditionally very positive but challenging relationship with the European Union. 
SEP17	Dear Danni Levy, enough of the fat-shaming. Sarah Thomas is what a fit person looks like	Danni Levy, fitness trainer and star of short-lived series Life on Marbs, told the nation on Good Morning Britain that we should fat-shame people to end obesity. Her words came in response to a line from James Corden’s segment last week, which struck a chord with plenty of viewers: “If making fun of fat people made them lose weight, there’d be no fat kids in schools.”
SEP17	We don't need to impeach Brett Kavanaugh for political reasons. We need to impeach him for moral reasons	The newest and most controversial justice on the US Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, is facing renewed scrutiny and calls for impeachment from some Democrats today, following a New York Times essay this weekend alleging that he was seen sexually harassing another woman while at Yale University.   Questions into Kavanaugh’s fitness for the office came to the fore during September of last year when Dr Christine Blasey Ford, a professor and research psychologist at Stanford University, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school. 
SEP17	Cameron has never looked and sounded more like the heir to Blair. Brexit is his Iraq	David Cameron has had three long years to ruminate on what it was that went so badly wrong with the whole EU referendum thing. And yet, even now, he exudes the air of a man who brought a cake to a coffee morning because no one told him it was in fact a knife fight to which everybody else would be bringing a gun. ITV’s Tom Bradby is one a very small number of people who have been allowed to read Cameron’s memoirs prior to their release next week. And like everyone else who has done he has come to the same crucial conclusion, which is that, spread over 800 long pages, the chap who led the Remain campaign “comes across as a raging Eurosceptic”.
SEP17	Trump is spreading his own fake news about Iran. But why?	Over the weekend, reports emerged that an Iran-backed Yemeni rebel group was responsible for a drone attack on an oil processing facility belonging to Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company. And as is his wont, Trump took to his Twitter account to decry reports that he was willing to meet with Iranian leaders. 
SEP17	Trump tries to talk tough, but Iran's Revolutionary Guards are running rings round him	Mr Fire and Fury is back – and this time, he says, he’s locked and loaded.

SEP17	Britain has run out of compassion for treasonous ‘Jihadi brides’, but lacks the legal teeth to act	Ever since Shamima Begum was found in a Kurdish-run camp in northern Syria, the debate on whether she (and others) should be left overseas or brought back to face charges in the UK has raged unabated. The Sunday Times recently reported that police and UK intelligence agencies are looking to bring a number of charges against these so-called “Jihadi brides” when some of them attempt to return to the UK. If they expect to be greeted as victims of radicalisation rather than criminals, they may be unpleasantly surprised. Public sentiment has turned significantly against these individuals, and the space for forgiveness has considerably narrowed.
SEP18	Boris Johnson thought he was invincible – but meeting the public has left him well and truly humbled	According to his biographers – and why doubt them? – Boris Johnson likes to be popular. He wants to be loved. Not, that is, hated. It is what has driven most of his political ventures, and, I have to add, some of the adventures in his personal life. It is why he enjoys getting up in front of an adoring audience so much, or a hostile one, and making a few self-deprecating remarks to make friends with enemies. A ruffle of the hair, a shrug of the shoulders, the act of forgetting his lines, the bumbling, the deployment of an inherently absurd prop (a chicken, brick, kippers, a Cornish pasty) a knowing smirk, an over the top cheesy joke (eg “Jeremy Corbyn thinks our friends are in the Kremlin, and in Tehran, and in Caracas – and I think he’s Caracas!”) – these all are just some of his little tricks to charm and enchant the adoring and the sceptical alike. As leader of the Leave campaign in 2016, as mayor of London and now as party leader and prime minister there is nothing he likes more, literally and metaphorically, than to find himself marooned on a zip-wire waving a couple of union jacks, the harness biting into his groin with increasing insistence. He is a very happy clown.
SEP18	Ben Stokes deserves our sympathy, but The Sun had every right to run their story	It was hard not to feel sympathy for Ben Stokes. How could we not? The Sun, with its characteristically stark headline, had apparently chosen to resurface for the first time in over 30 years, the murder of two young children who, had it not been for a tragic chain of events, would have been the England cricketer’s half siblings. As you scrolled through Twitter and read Stokes’ reaction to the story, you might have thanked your lucky stars you weren’t him, or indeed, any person who might find themselves the subject of this kind of media attention.
SEP18	The end of Labour Students is actually a sign that Corbynism is waning	Student politics barely matter to most students and really shouldn’t matter to anyone more than two years out of university or college. Anyone who thinks too much about the complex voting system of a student organisation they've long since left is not the kind of person you want to be stuck with at a party. Yet decision of the Corbyn-controlled National Executive Committee (NEC) to scrap Labour Students – long a Blairite thorn in the leader of the opposition's side – shows an acceleration of a party takeover project that may, in fact, hint that the Corbynites' time is now limited. The NEC appears to be racing to make as much structural change as possible to benefit the left of the Labour Party, so this latest move is worth a little examination.
SEP18	Sex and scoliosis: A conversation on disability and intimacy is long overdue	Despite one in five people in the UK identifying as disabled (having a longstanding illness, disability or impairment that causes significant challenges to activities of daily life) – it is virtually impossible to access information on how to navigate disability, sex and relationships. Inspired by Brook’s theme for sexual health awareness week – sex and disability – I decided to chat to others living with scoliosis (a curvature of the spine). I was 14 when I underwent spinal surgery for scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) – I had metal Harrington rods inserted in my body, my right rib removed for bone grafting and had to have a back brace for a year. Aside from chronic back pain and a slight leg length discrepancy (I wear a foot raise in all my right shoes) my condition is entirely hidden. It meant significant changes to my mobility, acquiring new scars and altered the way I navigate relationships, yet it was something I was ill-prepared for. So, with so many people living with disability, why is this not something that we discuss more?
SEP18	The Israeli election doesn't have a clear winner. This is what that means for Netanyahu — and Donald Trump	With no clear winner in Israel’s election this week — as the Blue and White party and the incumbent Likud party are so far basically neck-and-neck, with 32 seats and 31 seats out of 120 respectively — the next governing coalition in Israel may not be formed for several weeks. While it seems unlikely Netanyahu will remain prime minister, it is still premature to count him out. But what is clear – as could have been predicted before this second election, five months after Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition –is that while Netanyahu’s career as prime minister may be over, a nationalist right-wing agenda prevails.  The Blue and White Party — led by former IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz and by Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu Party — may be Likud’s rivals, but they share that agenda. That means an end to settlements, an end to the military occupation of Palestinians, and work towards a negotiated two-state solution along pre-1967 borders is simply not on the agenda. 
SEP18	Sorry Remainers, Corbyn will never oppose Brexit. He still thinks he can avoid the Europe question	“People before privilege” will be Labour’s theme at its annual conference starting this weekend, with Jeremy Corbyn portrayed as on the side of the people and Boris Johnson the representative of the privileged few. “Trust the people” will be another slogan on Labour lips, as Corbyn tries to unite his party around a policy on Brexit that he hopes will also unite the country. The Labour leader will argue that the politicians have failed to resolve the issue, and so the people must decide. At the looming general election, he wants to offer a Final Say referendum, with a choice between Remain and a soft Brexit deal he would negotiate with the EU.
SEP18	The coming election will be vicious. Politicians need a code of honour to stop the country being ripped apart	It may not have seemed possible, but the tectonic plates of British politics have drifted still further apart.  At the Liberal Democrat autumn conference the party pledged to revoke Article 50 without a referendum, pushing themselves even more firmly into the Remain camp in the process. Another Conservative moderate, Sam Gyimah, left his party, enlarging their centrist vacuum. 
SEP18	No, refusing to share sex of your child does not help tackle gender bias – it only makes it worse	“What’s their name?” It’s the single most common – and most infuriating – question every new parent is asked. It’s considered the polite way to ask the sex of the baby, and avoid “‘offending” the besotted new mum or dad by getting it wrong. Many parents try to avoid this pantomime by offering up signals in the form of pink or blue clothing. But why do we still feel the need in 2019, to make the message so clear? Yesterday, Jake England-Johns and Hobbit Humphrey appeared BBC One’s Inside Out programme to discuss their decision to keep their baby’s gender a secret, to allow their child to “be themselves” and keep them free from “the gender bias that society places on children”.
SEP19	Boris Johnson has gone so barmy he doesn’t even know what a journalist looks like	There are times when you realise how fortunate we are to live in a free society with a media that questions authority. For example, our prime minister visited a hospital and met a sick child’s father, who was angry at the state of that hospital, and angry that Boris Johnson visited for “a press opportunity”. And Johnson replied “there’s no press here”, in front of a big pile of press. But luckily our most prominent political reporter dared to hold the powerful to account, by revealing the father is in the Labour Party, the deceitful pig.
SEP19	God help the Queen. She's been used and abused by Eton schoolboys conniving for political gain	I’m not quite sure I understand what is going on here. Two – two – Old Etonian prime ministers dragging their sovereign lady the Queen into the muddy morass of politics. Well, we might expect no more of Boris Johnson, who fibs and farts his way through life; but the gentlemanly David Cameron? I almost as mortified as when I first heard the allegation (since snortingly denied) that Cameron had been fellated by a (dead) pig whilst at university (Cameron, not the pig). 
SEP19	I hired a doula who didn’t turn up when I gave birth. This growing ‘profession’ needs regulation	In September 2018, my husband and I met with joy the news that we would become parents the following May. I had joined my husband in London, from Italy, two years before and got married very recently. In early Spring 2019, as the due date was approaching, we decided to look for the support of a post-natal doula, an idea widely recommended to parents, like us, who live in London with no supporting families.
SEP19	The Sun has no excuse for publishing its story about Ben Stokes’s family	Madeline Palacz’s article “Ben Stokes deserves our sympathy, but The Sun had every right to run their story” glosses over a number of important details in its defence of The Sun’s decision to publish personal and sensitive details relating to Ben Stokes’s family background. Palacz makes no reference to the total disregard The Sun’s coverage showed in respect of domestic violence reporting guidelines, which were designed by feminist advocacy organisation Level UP, and supported by Hacked Off, to protect the dignity of deceased victims and ensure perpetrators are treated fairly under the law. Those guidelines highlight, for example, the dangers of giving perpetrators “positive character references” – yet the killer is described by a “family source” in The Sun as a “popular, easy-going guy”.
SEP19	Ben Stokes deserves our sympathy, but The Sun had every right to run their story	It was hard not to feel sympathy for Ben Stokes. How could we not? The Sun, with its characteristically stark headline, had apparently chosen to resurface for the first time in over 30 years, the murder of two young children who, had it not been for a tragic chain of events, would have been the England cricketer’s half siblings. As you scrolled through Twitter and read Stokes’ reaction to the story, you might have thanked your lucky stars you weren’t him, or indeed, any person who might find themselves the subject of this kind of media attention.
SEP19	The end of Labour Students is actually a sign that Corbynism is waning	Student politics barely matter to most students and really shouldn’t matter to anyone more than two years out of university or college. Anyone who thinks too much about the complex voting system of a student organisation they've long since left is not the kind of person you want to be stuck with at a party. Yet decision of the Corbyn-controlled National Executive Committee (NEC) to scrap Labour Students – long a Blairite thorn in the leader of the opposition's side – shows an acceleration of a party takeover project that may, in fact, hint that the Corbynites' time is now limited. The NEC appears to be racing to make as much structural change as possible to benefit the left of the Labour Party, so this latest move is worth a little examination.
SEP19	What happens when the Democratic candidacy becomes a war between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?	Democratic insiders have worried for months that polls may be overstating Joe Biden’s advantage over a resurgent left led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In May, Biden held the high ground, commanding support from 41 per cent of Democrats nationally. Just a few months later, his share has fallen to 26 per cent. Nearly a third of voters who supported Biden four months ago now support another candidate. The main beneficiaries of Biden’s decline? Sanders and Warren. Warren’s rise is bolstered by strong debate performances and massive rally crowds. According to political prediction market PredictIt, Warren is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Much of Warren’s success comes from the strength of her policy arguments – so far she has avoided the ‘moderate vs. progressive’ arguments that wrap other candidates into knots.
SEP19	Brexit has given us constitutional constipation  – our democratic process needs a clear out	Parliament is a horrible place at the moment. A shambling, slouching, undead thing; a zombie that stinks of decay but won’t die. We need a Van Helsing to drive a stake through its heart, and lay it to rest. Like all the best horror movies, this monster was created by human failings. The scriptwriters of this particular freak show are the Liberal Democrats, who demanded fixed term parliaments as part of their price for joining the coalition government in 2010, and the departing speaker, John Bercow, who invented new rules to strip control of parliament’s agenda away from the government earlier this year.
SEP19	I need you to stop tone-policing Bernie Sanders	During last week’s Democratic Debate, Bernie Sanders, one of the handful of frontrunners thus far, was caught with a raspy tone in his voice. His go-to talking points of Medicare-for-All and taxing the millionaires and billionaires were accented in a way which left many joking about handing the US Senator a cough drop. Some critics even went so far as to suggest that this was a symptom of his persistent use of an “outside voice”, regardless of where he actually is. Bernie, they said, really needs to stop yelling. The topic came up first during the July debate, when Sanders was speaking on the topic of climate change. Presidential hopeful Rep. Tim Ryan, in response to Bernie mentioning how tired he was of hearing Democrats afraid of big ideas, said the Senator “didn’t have to yell”. Misreading it as a breakout moment for Ryan, his campaign managers announced the sale of “You Don’t Have To Yell” bumper stickers after the debate — which were subsequently ridiculed online. 
SEP19	Boris Johnson thought he was invincible – but meeting the public has left him well and truly humbled	According to his biographers – and why doubt them? – Boris Johnson likes to be popular. He wants to be loved. Not, that is, hated. It is what has driven most of his political ventures, and, I have to add, some of the adventures in his personal life. It is why he enjoys getting up in front of an adoring audience so much, or a hostile one, and making a few self-deprecating remarks to make friends with enemies. A ruffle of the hair, a shrug of the shoulders, the act of forgetting his lines, the bumbling, the deployment of an inherently absurd prop (a chicken, brick, kippers, a Cornish pasty) a knowing smirk, an over the top cheesy joke (eg “Jeremy Corbyn thinks our friends are in the Kremlin, and in Tehran, and in Caracas – and I think he’s Caracas!”) – these all are just some of his little tricks to charm and enchant the adoring and the sceptical alike. As leader of the Leave campaign in 2016, as mayor of London and now as party leader and prime minister there is nothing he likes more, literally and metaphorically, than to find himself marooned on a zip-wire waving a couple of union jacks, the harness biting into his groin with increasing insistence. He is a very happy clown.
SEP20	It is Britain’s historic duty to achieve zero carbon by 2030 – and the Labour Party must take the lead	With Labour party conference in Brighton this week climate will be at the top of the agenda. One-hundred and twenty-eight constituencies have submitted the Labour for a Green New Deal motion to Labour conference, calling for a zero carbon target of 2030. This is more than any other subject – even Brexit. There should be no doubt about the depth of feeling amongst Labour Party members, and with 85 per cent of the country concerned about climate change, the time for action is already upon us. Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and her team have set a cracking pace on developing a policy platform for the transition to the low carbon economy, and Jeremy Corbyn has insisted the next Labour government will launch a “green industrial revolution”, delivering jobs and opportunity across the country as we shift our whole economy towards a low-carbon future. Plans to install 2 million solar panels are just the latest step along the path.
SEP20	Labour can abolish Boris Johnson if it promises to abolish the private schools that created him	Boris Johnson wants the next election to be about Brexit betrayed. He wants to pitch it as parliament vs the people, with himself – an old Etonian career politician – as a man of the people. For Labour there is no path to victory which does not confront and expose this hypocrisy. Boris Johnson represents the privileged few in whose favour our entire society is rigged. Labour can highlight this with bold and popular policies, which grab attention and move the fight onto home turf. If Labour is committed to ending privilege, it must pledge to abolish Eton. Next week, it will have such an opportunity. Labour Party conference will, for the first time in decades, focus its sights on the grotesque inequality of private education. A grassroots campaign has led local branches to submit a proposal for the full integration of all private schools into the state sector. No more fee-paying schools, their resources equally shared.
SEP20	I was the only Republican witness at the climate change Congressional hearing this week — and I feel optimistic	 Yesterday, history was made in Washington DC. For the first time ever during a Congressional hearing, young conservatives and young progressives joined forces to advocate for climate change reforms. I had the opportunity, as the only Republican-chosen witness, to testify in front of the United States Congress on behalf of a generation that cares more about climate solutions than climate politics. This is no small feat.

SEP20	The Top 10: Newspaper corrections	I started to collect these five years ago, which is why so many of them date from 2014. It’s like discovering a childhood stamp collection.  1. “Last week’s NALGO News reported the general principles involved in the clinical grading appeals for horses, midwives and health visitors. This, of course, should have read ‘nurses’. Our apologies for any offence or embarrassment this typographical error may have caused.” (Undated, but the National and Local Government Officers’ Association merged with Unison in 1993.) Thanks to Els Freshwater. 
SEP20	I'm less offended by Justin Trudeau's blackface than I am by his policies	As elections loom, revelations from Justin Trudeau’s past — specifically times when he donned black- and brownface in an offensive parody of minority communities — have shaken up liberal Canada. But such discoveries came as little surprise to me from a man whose government has an appalling track record with minority rights and who has been accused of cultural appropriation while in office. Faux-liberalism has engulfed international politics across the world as politicians seek to win over hearts and minds and counter the rise of Trump and Brexit-style populism. Trudeau, and other aspiring leaders, have consistently painted themselves as liberals while enacting disastrous policies with a smile. As a white male, born into privilege and political dynasty, Trudeau needed to appeal to Canada’s growing minority community in order to stay relevant. Race, environment, sexuality and gender issues all feature prominently in his speeches and campaigns — but they were merely approached as “check-box” exercises with few concrete policies to back them up, according to his former parliamentary secretary, Celina Caeser-Chavannes.
SEP20	Yes, it is a climate crisis. And your tiny human efforts have never seemed so meagre	Talk of a climate crisis moves to the top of the agenda again, just as the burning of the Amazon forests drifts from our headlines. But are we really heading towards a collective suicide? We instinctively feel that by destroying the Amazon rainforests, Brazilians are killing “the lungs of our Earth”. However, if we want to confront seriously threats to our environment, what we should avoid are precisely such quick extrapolations which fascinate our imagination.
SEP20	Russians deserve to live in a free democracy – the world must come to their defence	 As residents of the free world concerned about the future of global democracy, we have been observing the disturbing unfolding events in Moscow and other Russian cities over the past month.
SEP20	This is how teachers can support their pupils and mobilise for action in the climate strikes	On 20 September students across the world will return to the streets to continue to protest against climate change. This time, they have called upon adults to join them for what they hope will be the world’s biggest climate mobilisation. Since the UK strikes begun last autumn, there has been much discussion of the appropriate response from educators. Many have expressed whole-hearted enthusiasm for the students’ protests, because as a generation we have overwhelmingly failed to prevent the climate catastrophe and so many of us, like myself, are delighted to see young people leading the way. Hopefully they will succeed where we have not.
SEP21	Labour will offer a real Brexit option to the people – that is the only democratic way to solve this crisis	Much worry has been expressed over the past year about Jeremy Corbyn’s approach to Brexit, but in the past few weeks he has shown some skill in adopting a position that brings Labour closer to its members, voters and, above all, values.  Jeremy is now promising to back a people’s vote in all circumstances – not just if it’s a Tory Brexit, but if we win the next election too. 
SEP21	Being childfree by choice doesn’t make being the only one in my group of friends any less isolating	If you’re on social media, I’m sure you haven’t missed the recent wave of back-to-school photos. Blazers, shiny shoes, pigtails and bobs. Each time the obligatory photos are posted, I know it’s not my day for Facebook. I take a step back, and wait for the news feed to balance again. I shall never be the person to add a photo. Instead, I live on the periphery. I hang out on the sidelines, often floating, mute, above conversations, in person and on WhatsApp. I’m the one in my group who isn’t a mum. It can be isolating – especially when it’s your choice.

SEP21	If you’re striking for the climate this Friday, why not go vegan as well?	On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it. While this is a worthwhile endeavour, there’s no need to wait for a special date to commit to saving the planet. If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs, and dairy from your shopping list. 
SEP21	I hired a doula who didn’t turn up when I gave birth.

SEP21	I usually punch up, but the views of some Brexiteers are so diabolical I have to make an exception	If you wanted an example of the callous selfishness of hardline Brexiteers, the BBC sure dug one up on the streets of Birmingham.  It was another series of vox pops, canvassing the views of “ordinary people”. (They never seem to take place in Remain areas, but there you go.)

SEP22	Labour has already backed Remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – It’s England that needs to catch up	Day two of conference in sunny Brighton, and UK Labour’s Brexit policy is about to be decided. Tonight is the important composite meeting, where the final text of Labour’s policy will be decided upon by delegates ahead of Monday's crucial vote.  UK Labour must join the view of the devolved nations and commit to an unambiguous stance to campaign for Remain. 
SEP22	Corbyn won't touch Clause IV, but Labour will be wrestling with it forever	The Labour Party is often searching for a big idea. All politicians like to show some evidence of wanting “change”, but in Labour – as with other parties of the left – there is often an appetite for a renewed statement of ideological intent. As the world changes, and as party leaderships change, there are different views as to what the party’s core objectives should be. So leaders consider whether they need something new. Ever since the party’s 1959 election defeat, the statement of aims in its constitution has been the obvious place to go – known simply as “Clause IV”. Hugh Gaitskell pushed to rewrite Clause IV in 1959, and Tony Blair saw it rewritten for a new era when he became leader in 1994. It evidenced change to an electorate still uncertain about Labour’s intentions, and it allowed Blair’s “New” Labour to revise its aims for a very different world.

SEP22	This is why the Northern Ireland prostitution review is a complete failure	Imagine doing research on whether or not smoking cigarettes is a health hazard and requesting data on this from the tobacco industry? Or a major sugar company about dental health? Research published this week on the sex trade in Northern Ireland uses data from Escort Ireland (EI), described once as a “cash cow” for the sex trade in Ireland. The research, by academics from Queen’s University Belfast, is a review of the effectiveness of the law criminalising those who pay for sex. In 2015, Northern Ireland joined Sweden, Norway, Canada and France and made the purchase of sex a criminal offence. Known as the Nordic model, the aim is to reduce demand for prostitution and break the connection between the sex trade and organised crime. This would also decriminalise the selling of sex so that prostituted people are better able to seek support.

SEP22	Alison Rose’s appointment at RBS does very little to advance women’s equality	RBS has confirmed that Alison Rose will assume the role of chief executive from November. Rose will become the first female boss of a top four British bank and her appointment brings the total number of female FTSE 100 CEOs back to the heady heights of 2017 when the tally stood at... seven. That’s right: seven. As in one more than six, one less than eight and very definitely not in double digits.  Over the last decade, there has been a lot of focus on the need for more equality and diversity in the boardroom. In 2010, Dame Helena Morrissey founded the 30% Club in an attempt to propel female representation at board level out of the single digits. Her campaign has been successful, with the figure now standing at 29.9 per cent.
SEP22	In the Labour civil war, is Corbyn the medieval plotting king or the ruler of chaos?	How convenient that Jeremy Corbyn left the meeting of Labour’s national executive just before the chair of his supporters’ organisation proposed a motion to abolish the post of deputy leader of the party.  This allowed Corbyn, like a medieval king, to be absent while his knights discussed getting rid of a turbulent priest, only to step in the next morning to urge conciliation and restraint. 
SEP22	I usually punch up, but the views of some Brexiteers are so diabolical I have to make an exception	If you wanted an example of the callous selfishness of hardline Brexiteers, the BBC sure dug one up on the streets of Birmingham.  It was another series of vox pops, canvassing the views of “ordinary people”. (They never seem to take place in Remain areas, but there you go.)
SEP23	Labour says no to Remain. It was the shabbiest spectacle I’ve ever seen	Perhaps the only way to make sense of all the shouting and screaming and chanting and voting as the Labour Party moved to formalise its most recent position on Brexit, is to close our eyes and transport ourselves to your front door in a few weeks time. Knock knock.
SEP23	Inside the UN General Assembly, diplomats like me are watching a new world order emerge	Roll up, roll up, the circus of the year comes into town again. The barricades are in place and a swarm of blue-shirted police officers and security guards are primed and ready. Midtown Manhattan will be in gridlock and when the circus moves on, around a $1bn will be injected into Manhattan’s already burgeoning economy. The big draws of the 74th edition of the General Assembly will be Greta Thunberg and the climate emergency, the ongoing “will he/won’t he blow up” saga of President Trump, and work towards ending the proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen – and with so much focus on such huge issues, much will be missed. Just as important are the topics which usually slip under the radar.
SEP23	Brexit is hurting the UK’s productivity – and wages with it	The statement published by the Bank of England last week, alongside its decision to keep interest rates unchanged (no surprises there), contained this line: “Productivity growth appeared to have weakened further so far this year.” That’s a rather more ominous announcement than it might sound. Labour productivity – commonly measured as GDP per hour worked – isn’t just a concept for economists to obsess about. If workers are more productive, firms can afford to pay them more.
SEP23	I was stopped from speaking out against Israel’s crimes – Britain’s complicity in Palestinian repression must end	I was set to take part in a Labour Party conference fringe event this weekend talking about my work advocating for Palestinian rights – but was unable to travel to Brighton because of a peculiar delay in the processing of my UK visa application. I suspect that Israel’s far-right government has once again outsourced its desperate war of repression against those supporting Palestinian rights to another western government. I was invited to two different events, organised by the National Education Union, Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Momentum-aligned fringe event The World Transformed, to speak about the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality and our nonviolent resistance to Israel’s decades-old regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid.
SEP23	Ben Ali’s death marks the official end of autocracy in Tunisia – but the nation isn’t out of the woods yet	When the breaking news came out that Tunisian autocratic ex-ruler Zine el Abidine Ben Ali had died on Thursday, few moments of caution and need for verification followed before official information confirmed his death in Jeddah. Rumours of his death have circulated several times over the years.  Symbolically, for a lot of Tunisians, the 83-year-old tyrant, who was absent from the political scene for eight years, had died a long time ago. While he was in exile in Saudi Arabia in the years following the revolution, the country moved on to adopt a new constitution, swear in its first democratically elected president Beji Caid Essebsi, and elect a fresh parliament making solid steps into the democracy-building process.

SEP23	Only Boris Johnson could get away with a scandal as damning as this – and that’s precisely the problem	At virtually any other peacetime moment in our island story, juicy revelations about the prime minister and a showgirl, including what appear to be unusual financial arrangements, would be the talk of the town.  You can imagine, I think, what might have happened had the allegations about Boris Johnson’s relationship with the former model and businesswoman Jennifer Acuri had, instead, been about Tony Blair during the full pomp of new Labour. Or the happily married David Cameron? Or, admittedly less likely, Gordon Brown, the sort of chap who probably thinks a pole dancer is Donald Tusk on a night out. 
SEP23	It shouldn’t be left to people like Omar Salem to question Johnson – it should be the job of MPs like me	The prime minister ran into my friend Omar Salem this week during a publicity visit with a press pack to the hospital ward where Omar’s daughter was being treated. And then an almighty row kicked off. I care about Omar, and, though obviously I have never met her, by proxy I care about his tiny baby in a hospital ward.  Since most of us are born in the NHS and proud of it, we are wildly, if rationally, emotional about babies in NHS hospitals. When the care is brilliant we think that our health service that cradles us is a miracle. When it goes wrong we feel national shame. We get as angry as Omar did.
SEP23	British politics is awash with oil money – only when we flush it out can we save the planet	Two headlines have caught my attention over the past week. The first concerned a frankly frightening report published ahead of this week’s UN climate action summit.  Backed by the world’s major climate science bodies, it found that commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions will need to be at least tripled if the world is to have any hope of meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. 
SEP23	Theresa May-style evasion, Trump-esque smears on the media – Corbyn's performance on Marr had it all	Even in these wild political times, the annual Jeremy Corbyn set-piece interview retains its status as one of the Grand Slam events, and this year’s was a classic for the ages. It had it all. The piety, the tetchiness, the May-esque refusal to answer a simple question, the Trump-esque baseless attacks at the media, absolutely all of it.
SEP24	I'm watching my country collapse from afar — but Boris Johnson's UN meeting with Trump made me oddly optimistic	There’s nothing like moving to America to make you realise how little your small, European country’s politics matter. When I came out to New York, I was fresh from three years of reporting on Brexit: I’d stood in the newsroom and watched the EU referendum results come out, and then, not long after, I’d battled through the rain at 4am to get to the office and deal with the aftermath of the 2016 US election. To me, both seemed equally cataclysmic — but Brexit was painful on a personal level. I was glad to touch down on US soil and throw myself into covering the politics of the upcoming 2020 election and the Democratic debates; it felt like a reprieve. Over the last nine months that I’ve been resident in the US, my home country has undergone huge political turmoil which I’ve mostly learnt about through a barrage of panicked messages from friends and family at antisocial hours. When Boris Johnson became prime minister, I felt it like a dull thud. I remembered watching the shenanigans between him and Michael Gove play out a couple of years before and wondering whether it would all work out for him. The fact that it did, against all odds — and the fact that I cared, while US television rolled on, oblivious, and New Yorkers admitted they weren’t sure who the British PM was half the time anyway — made the rolling news on my phone’s BBC app feel like a niche political drama where I was one of its only ardent followers.
SEP24	This is the beginning of the end for Boris Johnson’s short, brutal, unhappy premiership	It is beginning to look like it, isn’t it? Lady Hale, wearing a huge brooch that resembled a venomous spider, delivered a near fatal dose of judicial poison in her carefully worded, logical and comprehensive take-down of Johnson’s suspension of parliament. Johnson was the big fat fly caught in a sophisticated legal web, a ready meal for the Supreme Court. Spiderwoman was scathing, and her colleagues backed her solidly. It was unanimous among the judges – 11-nil – an even better score than Manchester City inflicted on poor old Watford at the weekend. It could hardly have been more damning. In declaring the order in Council quashed they have left no room for Johnson to just organise a new prorogation, for that too would be quashed. He has no way out. It is a strategic defeat because it has strengthened the hand of parliament and weakened the government, permanently.
SEP24	Brexit is hurting the UK’s productivity – and wages with it	The statement published by the Bank of England last week, alongside its decision to keep interest rates unchanged (no surprises there), contained this line: “Productivity growth appeared to have weakened further so far this year.” That’s a rather more ominous announcement than it might sound. Labour productivity – commonly measured as GDP per hour worked – isn’t just a concept for economists to obsess about. If workers are more productive, firms can afford to pay them more.
SEP24	If you’re striking for the climate this Friday, why not go vegan as well?	On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it. While this is a worthwhile endeavour, there’s no need to wait for a special date to commit to saving the planet. If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs, and dairy from your shopping list. 
SEP24	Ben Ali’s death marks the official end of autocracy in Tunisia – but the nation isn’t out of the woods yet	When the breaking news came out that Tunisian autocratic ex-ruler Zine el Abidine Ben Ali had died on Thursday, few moments of caution and need for verification followed before official information confirmed his death in Jeddah. Rumours of his death have circulated several times over the years.  Symbolically, for a lot of Tunisians, the 83-year-old tyrant, who was absent from the political scene for eight years, had died a long time ago. While he was in exile in Saudi Arabia in the years following the revolution, the country moved on to adopt a new constitution, swear in its first democratically elected president Beji Caid Essebsi, and elect a fresh parliament making solid steps into the democracy-building process.
SEP24	On the distorted TV feed, the Supreme Court president spoke like a Dalek, but she only needed to say one word: exterminate, exterminate, exterminate	London was under the dying throes of Hurricane Humberto when the Supreme Court rose. The wind and rain almost broke the TV feed, distorting the crisp, certain voice of Lady Hale to that of a Dalek. It was fitting in its way. She spoke for 11 electrifying minutes but three words would have done. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
SEP24	As a law professor, I can see Boris Johnson hasn't committed a crime – he's done something far worse than that	Three years ago, Boris Johnson argued Britain should vote Leave, taking back control and “freeing” the UK from the European Court of Justice to make the British Supreme Court its top judicial body. Today, that same Supreme Court has given Johnson the most devastating verdict issued in a generation, and it’s left his premiership in tatters. Johnson's government prorogued parliament for five weeks. They argued that the extended suspension was simply needed to put together a new legislative agenda for a Queen's Speech next month, and that this was a political decision beyond review of the courts, meaning that any such intervention would be an act of judicial interference.
SEP24	The Supreme Court has left Boris Johnson with zero credibility – and no way to deliver Brexit	The impact of the Supreme Court ruling on Boris Johnson is about as damaging as it could be, given that Lady Hale could not sack him as prime minister on the spot. The court unanimously found that he misled the Queen, that his advice to suspend parliament was unlawful, and that parliament is therefore still in session. But, curiously, the ruling has little effect on how Britain will or will not leave the EU. The prime minister was already in a worse position on Brexit than I think most people realised. This decision simply welds shut the metal box in which he is trapped. His only way out is to pass a deal through parliament by 19 October – the date specified in the law passed before prorogation to prevent a no-deal Brexit. 
SEP24	My dad, Harry Leslie Smith, once inspired Labour conference. But this Brexit fudge would have saddened him	 My dad was 91 when he attended and spoke at a Labour Party conference for the first and only time, in 2014. If you’d had told him at 81 that 10 years’ later, he’d be a cherished grandfather of the Labour Party, he’d have said, “pull the other one.”
SEP25	Boris Johnson tells the MP for Batley and Spen: The best way to honour Jo Cox’s memory is to get Brexit done	“The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox would be, I think, to get Brexit done.” Those words left the prime minister’s lips in the House of Commons at just gone 8.30pm, on the day the house had been recalled to atone for his dishonesty.
SEP25	Nancy Pelosi is taking a huge gamble with her Trump impeachment inquiry	Lots of people would like to ask Nancy Pelosi one simple question: what took you so long? After two and a half years in which Donald Trump appeared in the eyes of his critics to abuse and twist every notion of what it meant to be presidential, the House speaker’s announcement could not have come soon enough. 
SEP25	If you’re striking for the climate this Friday, why not go vegan as well?	On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it.

If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs, and dairy from your shopping list. 
SEP25	The transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky isn't a real transcript — and there's a worrying reason for that	As Yogi Berra once said, it's deja vu all over again. Like the Mueller Report, the so-called "Nunes Memo" before that, and a Justice Department Inspector General report before that, Donald Trump claimed a newly-released document would vindicate him from charges of wrongdoing this week even though the document's contents did nothing of the sort.
SEP25	Boris Johnson can still be beaten by the opposition – but they have to do these five things first	After Boris Johnson’s humiliating defeat in the Supreme Court, the opposition should hope for the best but prepare for the worst. A sensible prime minister would cut his losses after being found guilty of unlawfully suspending parliament. But Johnson may go deeper into the heart of darkness as he tries to make good on his pledge to leave the EU “do or die” on October 31. So it is good news that Jeremy Corbyn is not falling into the trap of holding an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That could trigger a general election – and, by the time we knew the result, we would be in November. And unless Johnson asked the EU to delay Brexit, we would have crashed out.
SEP25	Attacking Supreme Court justices for doing their job has nothing to do with your rights	No surprise that the justices of the Supreme Court are now regarded as “fair game”, for the simple offence that they issued a judgment that was unhelpful to the Brexit cause. Their friendships, salaries, homes, relatives, careers and everything else is now, it would seem, open to attack. The aim – and I wonder how the laws of libel shall operate in such a world – is to undermine confidence in their competence, their impartiality and their job as protectors of all our rights and freedoms, and above all to impute their judgement with improper motives. A disgrace, but one for which there will be, apparently enough, legal redress. It is already happening. If you go for a stroll around the nuttier corners of the Leave Twittersphere, you will already see personalised attacks on the Supreme Court judges. They’re fairly pathetic. Sitting on the European Court of Human Rights, for example, is suggested as evidence for Europhiliac bias – even though the ECHR is not part of the EU and the UK ought to have representation on a body that sits in judgement on it.
SEP25	An Amazonian tribe adopted me as an honorary member decades ago – now they’re facing slaughter	Last week, the US Trump administration agreed a deal with the Brazilian Bolsonaro regime to open up more of the Amazon for “development”. In typical Trumpian doublespeak, it claimed that aiding private sector commerce in the Amazon was the only way to protect the precious rainforest and its invaluable biodiversity.
SEP26	Before Jo Cox was killed, my mum's job as an MP just gave us a busy life. Now, I am scared every day	After the chilling scenes in parliament last night I just don’t think I can stay quiet anymore. There’s a group of young people and children that need to be spoken for. The language used by our prime minister – not a far-right populist or provocative journalist, but our prime minister – is just beyond words. The fact that the head of our government is actually using language that helps incite violence toward MPs is so beyond dangerous I can’t even comprehend it in a modern society. 
SEP26	After a year of Imran Khan, Pakistan is finally stepping into its role as a world player	Imran Khan’s election victory in Pakistan last year was greeted by an outpouring of optimism and derision. The day he won, he appeared on television, visibly elated to address a celebrating Pakistan. Though he stuck to his campaign promises, he sounded different. As he stared straight into the eyes of his people, offering assurances that it wasn’t time to worry, presenting himself front-line for accountability, promising a Naya (new) Pakistan, it seemed he had finally transitioned from politician to Statesman: honest, conciliatory, human. In a country where hope had long crossed its sell-by date, his words offered a renewed lease of life and people clung on fiercely. Since then, his authentic, stirring avatar has reappeared, evoking long-buried patriotism among hungered Pakistanis. What Khan’s rallying for a Naya Pakistan did, however, was inflate expectations. Between wild-eyed fanaticism and outright bashing, most forgot the messy, scattered, gargantuan prospect Pakistan really is. Undeniably, Pakistan has been heading in the wrong direction for the last five decades; an extractive political system created a rent-seeking political and economic elite, benefitting a sliver of society at the expense of the masses. Fleeting periods appeared when the sea wasn’t choppy, but change never sustained. Amid the backdrop of such misgovernance, Khan’s rise as a legitimate political alternative led to the fanning of irrational expectancies.
SEP26	RuPaul's white Drag Race crew shows what happens when you attempt diversity without inclusion	RuPaul is a man of many colours: As a model, drag queen, and the host of RuPaul’s Drag Race, he’s often found draped in jewel-tone gowns, tucked into neon bodysuits, and under towers of platinum synthetic hair. To look at RuPaul in full drag is to acknowledge histories that are often forgotten, like the ballroom and drag scenes of the 80s and 90s or the performers and club kids who were vogueing long before Madonna. It’s the legacy of communities made up of predominantly queer and transgender people of colour like RuPaul who made space for themselves at a time where they were told they didn't belong. On Sunday evening, however, his out of drag look was more subdued: As RuPaul took to the press room to discuss his show’s win at the Emmys, he was dressed in a glossy black shirt under a powder pink silk suit cut with wide lapels and patterned with inky-black poppies. Behind him stood a row of faces – his producers, his judging panel, his crew – and, as one journalist noticed, they were almost uniformly white.
SEP26	Let's not forget that Obama made a quid pro quo deal just like Trump's — and that Republicans said it was grounds for impeachment	The declassified transcript of President Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and the just-released whistleblower complaint have proven to be Rorschach Tests. As with so much of Trump’s output, there is enough ambiguity here that his opponents and defenders alike are claiming vindication.  “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday. 
SEP26	I've just discovered my name is on a secret list of Jews being compiled by neo-Nazis	The first time I suspected I was on a list of Jews being compiled by neo-Nazis it hardly seemed worth mentioning. Scrolling through my Twitter feed before bed, I was surprised to receive a message containing a collage of a few of my old tweets and a picture of my old face. The person who got in touch felt he’d somehow caught me out because I have contradicted myself over the years, occasionally referring to myself as white though at other times I have not.
SEP26	Greta Thunberg faces the vitriol of men because she's a 16-year-old girl who isn't being sexualised	For the millions who have joined her strike for climate justice, Greta Thunberg is an inspirational 16-year-old who is rightly furious about the global disaster her generation is due to inherit. Yet to some prominent men, she’s "an annoying little brat", "the maypole around which all the eco loonies now dance", and a "weird…lass…bless her". Leave.EU donor Arron Banks even hinted he'd like her to become the victim of a "freak yachting accident", while Donald Trump sarcastically deemed her "a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future". 
SEP26	It is our job to protect Britain from climate change, and Britain needs a reality check on the flooding to come	Our coastline is moving inland. Flooding is becoming more frequent. The costs of managing flooding and coastal change are increasing. Depending on where you live, you may be blissfully unaware, but the impacts of global warming are creating a new normal right here, right now.  This week’s stark warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the growing risk of extreme sea-level events makes it clear: Business as usual is no longer a credible response. But how do we ensure our nation responds to the climate threat of rising seas and increased flood risk?
SEP27	The whistleblower crisis has proven that nominating Joe Biden would be a gift to the Trump campaign	Usually, when you ask Elizabeth Warren a policy-related question, she gives you a definite answer. Yet, when asked about an issue which presently affects one of her principal opponents this week, Warren became visibly flustered. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga pressed the rising presidential candidate on whether or not her ethics plan would allow her vice president's son to serve on the board of a foreign company. "No," was her immediate response. And then: "I don't know. I mean I’d have to go back and look at the details."  Warren is not the only Democratic presidential primary contender who has been asked to weigh in. 
SEP27	Just as Iraq begins to find peace, it once again becomes the battleground for an American proxy war	People in Baghdad are fearful that the next war between the US and Iran will take place in Iraq, which is only just returning to peace after the defeat of Isis. Alarm that Iraq will be sucked into such a conflict has increased here because of recent Israeli drone attacks on the bases of the Iraqi paramilitary group known as the Hashd al-Shaabi, which is accused by the US and Israel of acting as a proxy of Iran. “The new development is that Israel has entered the conflict in Iraq,” says Abu Alaa al-Walai, the leader of Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, a militant Shia paramilitary movement with ties to Iran, speaking in an exclusive interview with The Independent in Baghdad. He says that three Israeli drones attacked one of his bases in the Iraqi capital, called al-Saqr, on 12 August, leading to the explosion of 50 tons of weaponry. The Israelis confirm that they carried out the raid, which was preceded by several others, claiming that they hit Iranian missiles on their way to Syria and Lebanon.

SEP27	Dominic Cummings will be the architect and face of any Brexit riots, and we should never let him forget it	Dominic Cummings, the man who seems to enjoy much influence over the prime minister, believes that we will have a “violent, popular uprising” if a second referendum was held and Remain won. How much of that, one wonders, is mere objective analysis, the product of that vast analytical intellect of his; and how much is in fact wishful thinking. “I predict a riot” is often a self-fulfilling prophecy.
SEP27	As a Red Cross volunteer, I saw the atrocities of the Mumbai attacks firsthand. I’m proud to help people in crisis	I remember getting the call very clearly. It was around 10pm on the 28 November 2008, and I was at home in Surrey. We were preparing for a big Christmas that year with my mother-in-law turning 90 and the American side of the family coming to visit. I was writing my Christmas letters when my husband burst into the room to tell me he’d seen the horrific attacks in Mumbai on the news. I'm a Red Cross volunteer and from that moment I was anticipating a call.
SEP27	I lost my son Charlie after a lengthy court dispute. Now I’m campaigning to revolutionise NHS care	It is often said that no parent should have to bury their child. This gets repeated a lot, but until you have been through it, it’s just another cliché. When we lost Charlie, the world felt backwards. Everything was in the wrong order. Upside down, brutal and final. Even worse was – and is – the feeling that we could have done more for him. I would not wish this upon my worst enemy.
SEP27	If we cancel HS2 now, Britain would waste a decade of work to revive regional rail networks	In November 2007 HS1 made it possible to travel at 300 kilometres per hour all the way from the centre of London to the city centres of Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. So it’s easy enough to understand why two years later, when plans were being developed to link the centre of London to the city centres of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, the Department for Transport should decide to call them HS2.   A decade on, it’s clear our country’s first intercity high speed railway needs a stronger message to help the world understand the transformational effect it will have on the UK economy. 
SEP28	Labour says it will scrap barbaric universal credit – but the trauma it has inflicted will not be so easy to erase	Scrapping universal credit – as announced by the Labour Party today – would be the best thing to happen to the nation’s mental health that I can think of and must become a cross-party priority. For the brutality of its rollout has been the final straw for many people, driving them to suicide or self-harm. Why? While neoliberalism has sold us a fantasy of atomised individuality, our inner worlds and embodied experience are partially shaped by how we are treated both in our early and current lives. As an example, if someone has been aggressive to us, we tend to take inside both the position of the aggressor and the aggressed. Aggression here might be direct – say, having been bullied at school – or indirect, such as absorbing overt or micro-aggressions towards people we identify as like us that swirl in our vicinity. How we experience ourselves and treat ourselves is partially a function of how we have been and are viewed.
SEP28	There is no solution to Brexit that will placate Leavers and Remainers – only turmoil awaits	As Boris Johnson’s increasingly rogue government ramps up the threats and rhetoric, and death threats land at MPs’ doors, Britain’s worried political herbivores are frantically hunting for a Brexit outcome that can put a divided country back together before its frenzied carnivores rip it apart for good. It is a worthy cause, but a deluded one. There is no Brexit outcome that will heal Britain’s divides. There is no deal that can be struck, no new vote that can be held, that will not inflame opinion on at least one side. A second referendum won’t do it. Nor will revocation. Nor will Norway Plus, nor Theresa May’s deal. No deal won’t cut it. Nothing can achieve it. It is impossible.

SEP28	The Top 10: Ideas For Controlling the Weather	This one was inspired by Donald Trump suggesting we should explode a nuclear warhead in a hurricane. Thanks to Robert Boston for the idea.  1. In the Odyssey, Aeolus, king of the winds, put all the winds in a leather bag except for the west wind so Odysseus could sail home to Ithaca. In the Aeneid, Juno offers Aeolus a wife as a bribe to calm the winds for Aeneas. “I doubt Trump is a student of either Homer or Virgil though,” said Graham Kirby.

SEP28	Outrage won’t work. Only a people-powered movement offering radical change can defeat Boris Johnson	Pundits have long predicted that if Boris Johnson became prime minister he would “go full Trump”, and this week we finally saw what that means. With Dominic Cummings suggesting that MPs getting death threats should just “get Brexit done”, and Johnson sparking outrage with his comments about Jo Cox, the atmosphere in parliament is becoming increasingly poisonous.  But how should Johnson’s opponents respond? Their almost exclusive focus on deploring the use of words like “surrender” and “betrayal” may only play into his hands. Johnson is appealing to a British public fed up with Brexit who want politicians to get back to sorting out the real problems affecting them: a creaking NHS, stagnant living standards, crumbling infrastructure. Just like Trump – as progressives should have learned after Hillary Clinton’s disastrous campaign – he cannot be beaten by political grandees defending a broken status quo, but only by a compelling alternative vision for change.  
SEP28	Dominic Cummings thinks he’s Otto von Bismark. In fact he’s Finchy from The Office	The only real question left to answer about Dominic Cummings, the former strategic genius whom you would now no longer trust to light one of his own farts without hospitalising himself, is whether he is Finchy to Johnson’s David Brent or the other way around. After watching the full six minutes of his perambulatory WTFgasm with Sky News’s Lewis Goodall, it is hard to decide which of The Office’s most iconic scenes it most closely represents.

SEP29	Brendan O’Neill’s encouragement of Brexit riots proves only the right are free to incite violence	As a British Muslim woman and journalist, it is always concerning to watch dangerous rhetoric being played out in the media from people that hold positions of authority. In the current climate, when political unrest, racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism are at their peak, vulnerable communities are the ones that have to bear the brunt of hate and discrimination the most. A prime example of this is the fact that Islamophobic incidents rose by 375 per cent in the week after Boris Johnson compared veiled Muslim women to “letterboxes”. Yet, despite there being a clear link between the words of those in power and the acts of those on the far right, commentators continue to hide behind the guise of freedom of speech and are continually given a platform to do so.
SEP29	As an Afghan immigrant, Britain and atheism showed me the bright side of democracy	There’s so much I wish I could tell people about me, like the fact that my dad doesn’t know how old he is (in Afghanistan they didn’t used to record birthdays), or that every day I am thankful to be living in a democratic state. I was naturalised as a British citizen when I was very young; being a Londoner is all I have ever known since the age of three. But there’s lots of little things that I adore which British-born citizens often overlook. I’ve been back to Kabul, where I was born, since settling in the UK. There is no sewage system, no waste management systems, no rule of law. People burn their garbage in the middle of the street. If you want to send a letter, you can’t because there’s no postal delivery system. Visiting a friend’s home for the first time? Good luck trying to find a map that helps you navigate locations; homes don’t even have door numbers. As aesthetically pleasing as some places were to visit, travelling to Afghanistan at an early age opened my eyes and gave me perspective. It’s one thing to read about democracy in a textbook, it’s another to experience first-hand how its manifestation can alter the fabric of one’s existence.

SEP29	A women-only hotel to avoid the male gaze? It’s just evading the problem	The Som Dona hotel in Majorca opened its gleaming glass doors for the first time earlier this summer with sparkling white sunbeds, modern minimalist decor and one rule regarding occupants to make it stand out from the pack: absolutely no men.  The hotel boasts a pool, a spa, a roof-top terrace, healthy food options and is open to all women (and girls over 14) whether they are travelling solo, as a couple or in a group with other women.

SEP29	How can anyone look at Greta Thunberg and say that 16-year-olds should be denied the vote?	Exhibit A: Greta Thurnberg. A figure of global import who at the age of 16 stands at the head of a peaceful campaign to clean up the planet despite having buckets of polluted bile thrown at her by supposedly “responsible” and “mature” adults every day. She can’t vote in her native Sweden. She wouldn’t be allowed to vote if she held British citizenship either.  Exhibit B: Boris Johnson, a bloviating, law-breaking demagogue who shamelessly, and successfully, encourages violence against other elected representatives. He can.

Johnson is appealing to a British public fed up with Brexit who want politicians to get back to sorting out the real problems affecting them: a creaking NHS, stagnant living standards, crumbling infrastructure. Just like Trump – as progressives should have learned after Hillary Clinton’s disastrous campaign – he cannot be beaten by political grandees defending a broken status quo, but only by a compelling alternative vision for change.  
SEP29	Dominic Cummings thinks he’s Otto von Bismark. In fact he’s Finchy from The Office	The only real question left to answer about Dominic Cummings, the former strategic genius whom you would now no longer trust to light one of his own farts without hospitalising himself, is whether he is Finchy to Johnson’s David Brent or the other way around. After watching the full six minutes of his perambulatory WTFgasm with Sky News’s Lewis Goodall, it is hard to decide which of The Office’s most iconic scenes it most closely represents.
SEP30	The Conservative Party’s ‘infrastructure revolution’ is nothing but a distraction from its toxic politics	That David Cameron’s memoirs appeared just before the Conservative conference provides a useful counterpoint, and reveals just how the party has changed. The true Blue activists who attend the conference are always loyal to the leader but there are degrees of enthusiasm. They tolerated Cameron, but perhaps never fully bought into his modernisation agenda. They respected Theresa May, but lost confidence in her when she delayed Brexit.
SEP30	I’m one of thousands of prisoners with no release date in sight – this is how the IPP sentence ruined my life	If you’re unfamiliar with Imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentences, let me fill you in. It's a draconian sentence and a human rights violation. As an IPP prisoner myself, I should know. Despite being abolished in 2012 by the European Court of Human Rights, so many of us are still locked up in – to use the government’s own words – a “not defensible” system that's overrun with violence, intimidation, drugs and very big on manipulation.  I've been in quite a few jails where the officers open prisoners up on the wing for association time, then go and lock themselves away in their offices, leaving us without support or protection. Prison is pretty much the wild west. And it's in that environment that IPPs like me have to prove we're not a risk to others in order to escape an indefinite sentence. It’s not easy. 
SEP30	Year after year, white teachers’ guilt stifles the fullness of Black History in our schools	In a school near you, they might be preparing for Black History Month. What you may not realise among the celebrations of familiar black history heroes such as Walter Tull and Martin Luther King are some of the questionable methods some teachers are using to do that. In the past couple of years alone, teachers have placed children under tables and asked them to imagine what life aboard a slave ship was like. They have also asked pupils to engage in mock slave auctions with rulers as proxy for whips to cultivate empathy, to learn lessons from the past and to ensure, as one white teacher admitted to me during my doctoral research, that people “know our shame” because she feels personally “guilty” about enslavement. But who is the “our” in her admission? Teachers in England overwhelmingly self-identify as white, and while it is perfectly justifiable and decent to feel emotions including guilt when encountering human tragedies, this should not be foundational for how black histories are engaged with.
SEP30	Human beings who need homes are complex. Our solutions to the housing crisis must be similarly intricate	As parliament sits again, and Boris Johnson threatens to reveal his domestic agenda, it’s time the government made the housing crisis a priority. The figures are getting increasingly hard to ignore: nearly half of private renters are one paycheck away from losing their home, homelessness among old people has soared 39 per cent, a homeless person dies every 19 hours. But research published earlier this week shows just how entrenched, complex, and ultimately difficult to solve this crisis is.
SEP30	As an Afghan immigrant, Britain and atheism showed me the bright side of democracy	There’s so much I wish I could tell people about me, like the fact that my dad doesn’t know how old he is (in Afghanistan they didn’t used to record birthdays), or that every day I am thankful to be living in a democratic state. I was naturalised as a British citizen when I was very young; being a Londoner is all I have ever known since the age of three. But there’s lots of little things that I adore which British-born citizens often overlook. I’ve been back to Kabul, where I was born, since settling in the UK. There is no sewage system, no waste management systems, no rule of law. People burn their garbage in the middle of the street. If you want to send a letter, you can’t because there’s no postal delivery system. Visiting a friend’s home for the first time? Good luck trying to find a map that helps you navigate locations; homes don’t even have door numbers. As aesthetically pleasing as some places were to visit, travelling to Afghanistan at an early age opened my eyes and gave me perspective. It’s one thing to read about democracy in a textbook, it’s another to experience first-hand how its manifestation can alter the fabric of one’s existence.
SEP30	Labour says it will scrap barbaric universal credit – but the trauma it has inflicted will not be so easy to erase	Scrapping universal credit – as announced by the Labour Party today – would be the best thing to happen to the nation’s mental health that I can think of and must become a cross-party priority. For the brutality of its rollout has been the final straw for many people, driving them to suicide or self-harm. Why? While neoliberalism has sold us a fantasy of atomised individuality, our inner worlds and embodied experience are partially shaped by how we are treated both in our early and current lives. As an example, if someone has been aggressive to us, we tend to take inside both the position of the aggressor and the aggressed. Aggression here might be direct – say, having been bullied at school – or indirect, such as absorbing overt or micro-aggressions towards people we identify as like us that swirl in our vicinity. How we experience ourselves and treat ourselves is partially a function of how we have been and are viewed.
SEP30	Iran has a plan B thanks to China and Russia – and it just might thwart the Trump administration	Following controversial strikes by Iran or its allies on the world’s single most important oil facilities and threats that the US was “locked and loaded” in preparation for an attack, Iran’s leaders did not hunker down in bunkers waiting for the bombs to start dropping. Hassan Rouhani, president of Iran, and Mohammad Javad Zarif, his foreign minister, instead went to Ankara, in a meeting that included Nato member Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, joking with president Vladimir Putin as he mocked US defence systems. Days after the attack, an Iranian official travelled to China to talk about a series of proposed mega deals that would potentially deepen Sino-Iranian economic cooperation and integrate Iran into Beijing’s belt and road programme.
SEP30	There is no solution to Brexit that will placate Leavers and Remainers – only turmoil awaits	As Boris Johnson’s increasingly rogue government ramps up the threats and rhetoric, and death threats land at MPs’ doors, Britain’s worried political herbivores are frantically hunting for a Brexit outcome that can put a divided country back together before its frenzied carnivores rip it apart for good. It is a worthy cause, but a deluded one. There is no Brexit outcome that will heal Britain’s divides. There is no deal that can be struck, no new vote that can be held, that will not inflame opinion on at least one side. A second referendum won’t do it. Nor will revocation. Nor will Norway Plus, nor Theresa May’s deal. No deal won’t cut it. Nothing can achieve it. It is impossible.
SEP30	Dominic Cummings thinks he’s Otto von Bismark. In fact he’s Finchy from The Office	The only real question left to answer about Dominic Cummings, the former strategic genius whom you would now no longer trust to light one of his own farts without hospitalising himself, is whether he is Finchy to Johnson’s David Brent or the other way around. After watching the full six minutes of his perambulatory WTFgasm with Sky News’s Lewis Goodall, it is hard to decide which of The Office’s most iconic scenes it most closely represents.
SEP30	The whistleblower crisis has proven that nominating Joe Biden would be a gift to the Trump campaign	Usually, when you ask Elizabeth Warren a policy-related question, she gives you a definite answer. Yet, when asked about an issue which presently affects one of her principal opponents this week, Warren became visibly flustered. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga pressed the rising presidential candidate on whether or not her ethics plan would allow her vice president's son to serve on the board of a foreign company. "No," was her immediate response. And then: "I don't know. I mean I’d have to go back and look at the details."  Warren is not the only Democratic presidential primary contender who has been asked to weigh in. 
OCT1	I’ve been speaking to Team Boris and this is what they know about the PM’s real Brexit deal plan	Deal or no deal? That is the question, as the moment of truth arrives on Brexit. In the next few days, we will know whether an agreement between the UK and EU is possible. On the face of it, the omens are not good. Ireland and the rest of the EU reacted furiously to overnight leaks of a British alternative to the Irish backstop. The leaks suggested the alternative would include a series of “customs clearance areas” five to 10 miles from the Irish border to avoid checkpoints. One Brussels insider told me these plans mirrored “what the Irish government would do in the emergency of no deal – they are not the proposal of a government which wants a deal”.
OCT1	Of course women’s heart attacks aren’t being diagnosed – our health problems are routinely ignored	The fear of misdiagnosis for medical conditions looms over most of us in the Google age. Are you certain it isn’t a brain tumour, doctor? Google says I could die any minute. I think this mole is about to kill me.  We’re all armchair psychiatrists and internet experts – or so we like to think – but is it at all surprising when we, especially women, aren’t getting the life-saving treatment we need? Perhaps it’s even essential. 
OCT1	Hanna Yusuf: ‘I didn't believe British Muslims were being victimised. Then I was stopped at Heathrow’	I've always been aware of the injustices British Muslims face, but I've sometimes doubted the narrative of the "Muslim victim". Why is it such a big deal if you're singled-out every now and then because of your appearance? If you have nothing to hide, there should be no problem – just cooperate, surely? Security officers would never apply a blanket stop and search; they only stop potential criminals with good reason, right?
OCT1	The Conservative Party’s ‘infrastructure revolution’ is nothing but a distraction from its toxic politics	That David Cameron’s memoirs appeared just before the Conservative conference provides a useful counterpoint, and reveals just how the party has changed. The true Blue activists who attend the conference are always loyal to the leader but there are degrees of enthusiasm.

OCT1	The Deep State conspiracy theory is making us all play defense	For years after 9/11, fair-minded people would sometimes have to battle it out with a conspiracy theorists about who perpetrated the attacks. It almost always centered around George W Bush: one particular pervasive theory was that he ignored warnings as an excuse to go to war. Others suggested that a shadowy government insider might have helped coordinate terrorism (famous YouTube videos claimed that the World Trade Center was bombed from within, for example.) We know that these rumors have no basis in reality. But conspiracy theories are often not flat-out lies. It's easier to get people to believe a conspiracy theory if it contains one or more truths. It is how some of President Trump's supporters have pushed and managed to convince others of the "Deep State" conspiracy to bring down the Trump presidency. 
OCT1	A year on from Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, and Saudi Arabia is lurching towards hysterical chaos	The Saudis are taking a pasting. Video pictures from the Houthis of Saudi soldiers and their allies killed or surrendering inside the Saudi border town of Najran represent a devastating blow to a kingdom which is constantly threatening war against Iran.  If it can’t protect its own armed forces inside Saudi territory, what is the point of wasting time menacing Iran with military action over the massive destruction of the oil facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais almost two weeks ago?
OCT1	Criticise the climate strikers if you like. In five years we'll all be at the ballot box and the world will change	Young people are increasingly outraged by the wholly inadequate response to the climate crisis. So far, society has failed. But more specifically, many of those in key positions have failed society. Too many “leaders” who have had the chance to help meet this challenge have ignored the scientific evidence for three decades.  Right now, we have 11 years to cut global emissions in half. Eleven years to redesign our economy. We urgently need a political mandate for systemic change and, right now, collective action through the climate strikes is one of the only tools that can deliver that. 
OCT1	The housing market get-rich-quick scheme is dead in the water. And not a moment too soon	For an anxious owner of an enormous mortgage, I’m going to say something unexpected: the lack of meaningful growth in house prices over the past year is a wonderful thing. The latest official data shows that the price of the average house in the UK inched up by a measly 0.7 per cent in July compared with July 2018. House price inflation has fizzled markedly since 2016 but, looking over a longer period, generally weaker price growth appears to be the new normal. 
OCT1	In 2016, I was a conservative Trump supporter — but I'm backing Elizabeth Warren in 2020	It’s been over a year since I decided to stop supporting President Trump and join the Democratic Party. I have also decided to support Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primaries. To this day, I am still asked why I made the transition — and I feel that I need to explain why. I was a conservative activist and writer for a couple of years prior to the 2016 election. I decided to do this because I felt threatened by Democrats, and I believed that they wanted to take our rights away — rights like freedom of religion, and speech. I believed Islam was a religion of terror. I believed Democrats wanted to destroy the sanctity of marriage. I had a myopic view of the second amendment, without seeing its full context. I condemned socialism and abortion. I wanted a wall to stop immigrants from “invading” America. 
OCT2	A Champions League qualification match, but no players. How Israel’s permit regime throws lives into disarray	Given the global obsession with football, it’s surprising that the cancellation of the Palestinian FA Cup final has gone virtually unnoticed abroad. For Palestinians the Fifa-recognised tournament is a big deal, not least because the winner qualifies to play in the Asian Champions League. The problem this year was that one of the teams was from the Gaza Strip. The first leg of the final, in Gaza, between the top Gaza club Khadamat Rafah and Balata FC, based in the largest West Bank refugee camp, was a 1-1 draw. The second leg, scheduled in Nablus for 3 July, never happened because Israel granted permits to only seven of the players to leave Gaza for the West Bank. 
OCT2	The Conservative Party is in love with Boris Johnson. It’s an affliction that never ends well	It is not merely Steve Baker quoting Satan at 1am that casts Conservative Party conference 2019 as a tale of angels and demons. Of course, it is theoretically possible to read too much into a complimentary latte hurriedly placed and then instantly snatched from Boris Johnson’s hand but really, all our names were on that little Starbucks cup.
OCT2	Of course women’s heart attacks aren’t being diagnosed – our health problems are routinely ignored	The fear of misdiagnosis for medical conditions looms over most of us in the Google age. Are you certain it isn’t a brain tumour, doctor? Google says I could die any minute.

OCT2	Rivers of Thirst: Kenya’s key water sources start to dry up	By Dan Kaburu for K24 TV in Kenya Mount Kenya, in the centre of the East African country, is what locals call a ‘water tower’. Dozens of rivers rise on its steep, high slopes and flow out in all directions.
OCT2	Hanna Yusuf: ‘I didn't believe British Muslims were being victimised. Then I was stopped at Heathrow’	I've always been aware of the injustices British Muslims face, but I've sometimes doubted the narrative of the "Muslim victim". Why is it such a big deal if you're singled-out every now and then because of your appearance? If you have nothing to hide, there should be no problem – just cooperate, surely?

OCT2	I’ve seen Boris Johnson’s ‘touchy feely’ nature up close. And it’s why I believe Charlotte Edwardes	I got into a bit of a Twitter furore this week, something I usually avoid. But I was, as they say, “triggered” by the response from some quarters to Charlotte Edwardes’ claim that Boris Johnson squeezed her thigh at a party 20-odd years ago.  People were saying that she was lying. People were also questioning her motives for flagging it up now. But it was Edwardes being called a liar that meant I couldn’t stand by.
OCT2	Tory moderates will see right through Johnson’s ‘One Nation’ vision – it died the day he let Brexit consume him	In the margins of the Tory conference, ministers have hyped up the prospect of reaching a Brexit deal. But there was little in Boris Johnson’s closing speech today to suggest agreement with the EU is possible. The prospect is receding. Johnson spoke the language of “compromise”, citing his proposal for Northern Ireland to align with EU single market rules. But he knew full well his “final offer” could only be an opening bid if any real progress is to be made. He knows his insistence on customs checks on the island of Ireland, even if away from the border, crosses a thick red line for the EU. The early reaction from Brussels was negative.
OCT2	After a teenager was almost killed, the end for Hong Kong now feels close	Making my way home through Hong Kong’s city centre on Tuesday evening, every shop, gym, restaurant and bar was closed. This once glittering high rise commercial district resembled one of those urban apocalypse scenarios for online combat games. There hadn’t been much in the way of festivities in Hong Kong to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on 1 October. Unless you find streets swathed in teargas and the repeated crack of beanbag rounds a means of celebration. These street battles are now widely referred to as “teargas buffets”, though there isn’t much in the way of a selection, as they reduce tourists, residents, journalists and anyone else not wearing an anti-gas respirator to stinging tears. 
OCT2	A year on from Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, and Saudi Arabia is lurching towards hysterical chaos	The Saudis are taking a pasting.

OCT3	Brussels insiders tell me they’re about to reject Boris Johnson’s new Brexit deal – and this is why	First, the good news for Boris Johnson. His long-awaited Brexit plan would probably be approved by the Commons. That would be quite a feat as it includes many elements of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times by majorities of 230, 149 and 58. But now the bad news: it is very unlikely to be put to a Commons vote in its current form because the EU looks set to reject it.
OCT3	Boris Johnson’s double-border Brexit plan for Northern Ireland is far worse than the backstop. This is why	A mop-haired, glittering embodiment of utter mediocrity and inexhaustible privilege stood behind a podium and declared he would never return with a polished turd and present it to the electorate. After much scrambling, he triumphantly returned to the podium, beseeched by awestruck, adoring eyes, and unveiled his “alternative to the polished turd”.
OCT3	Bernie Sanders' heart condition can teach us two lessons — one about healthcare and another about Congress	After the upsetting news that he had been rushed to hospital following chest discomfort earlier today, it was found that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had a blocked artery. Emergency surgery has left the Senator for Vermont on the road to recovery — and one thing he will not have to worry about is his medical bill. Given his position in government and income, he can cover the medical costs he is served. However, this incident should serve us as an important reminder of the desperate need for healthcare reform in the US, as well as the inspiring role Sanders himself has in calling for Medicare for all. Sanders and his colleagues in government, unlike the average American citizen, do not need to worry about health insurance coverage. Those in the Congress and the Senate benefit from federal subsidies amounting to three-quarter premiums under gold-level Obamacare policies, and need only to pay for between 25 and 28 per cent of the premium. Such unfairness was identified by Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez in the past, who noted that as a waitress she would have had to pay double what she now pays as a member of Congress. It is ironic that Congress has the power to “deny people affordability that they themselves enjoy,” Ocasia-Cortez tweeted.

OCT3	As the son of an immigrant, I know Priti Patel is telling you lies about free movement after Brexit	Priti Patel, our new home secretary, was rapturously received at Conservative Party conference this week as she triumphantly announced Tory plans to end free movement of people. As the audience whooped at her plans to rip our freedoms from us, she declared that, as a daughter of immigrants, she needed no lectures from the "north London metropolitan liberal elite" to say otherwise. This son of an immigrant does say otherwise.

OCT3	How Johnson’s Brexit proposal moves on from Theresa May’s – and why those changes could be crucial	Jeremy Corbyn’s instant verdict on the government’s Brexit proposal is that “it’s worse than Theresa May’s deal”. This may not be right, but it is probably the easiest way to analyse the proposal: how does it differ from May’s plan? The first difference is that it means a customs border in Ireland. Whereas May’s deal kept the whole of the UK in the EU customs territory until a long-term trade treaty was negotiated, Boris Johnson’s plan is to take the whole of the UK out of it. 
OCT3	The Labour Party's antisemitism problem might lie in a simple clash of identities	It’s not easy to make sense of the current furore about antisemitism and the left. But it may be that a fundamental part of the explanation is quite simple.  At a meeting of the synagogue that I attend – one of the largest in north London –  members were asked to hold up their hands to discuss which factors were the most important in promoting their sense of Jewish identity. A large number put up their hands when Israel was mentioned. Similarly, the Holocaust was seen as very important as was antisemitism. Jewish ritual and practice was not, relatively speaking, an important factor. 
OCT4	Jacob Rees-Mogg invokes the George Soros trope – and shows he is unfit to lead the House of Commons	Jacob Rees-Mogg, who wears suits that look as though his tailor is trying to drown him, is really turning out to be the least attractive adornment to the Johnson administration. He was foolish to invoke the name of George Soros in the current debate about people making money out of Brexit. It’s said that some people associated with Boris Johnson and Brexit have a large financial vested interest in seeing no-deal Brexit succeed, because it would crash the pound, which they have, in effect, betted against. The suggestion is that the government is being influenced in its actions, and Johnson’s leadership campaign was supported by people who stand to make vast sums out of a no-deal Brexit. This is something that the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, has raised, and his concerns were echoed in the House of Commons by the shadow leader, Valerie Vaz. Rees-Mogg’s response is that Soros is “one of the major funders, allegedly, of the Remain campaign, the sort of Remoaner funder-in-chief … who made a billion pounds when sterling crashed out of the exchange rate mechanism, which is five times as much as Mr Odey is said to have made”.
OCT4	Need another reason to support a four day week? Look no further than climate change	It seems like every week a new article appears promising the most effective ways to improve your work/life balance. The advice is usually as follows: “take on less”, “work smarter not harder”, “leave work at work”, “change the structure of your life”, and “limit time wasting activities and people”. Aside from offering the same predictably banal advice, these articles share another common theme: a belief that separating work and leisure is the sole concern of the individual. But as secure positions with stable hours become an increasingly rare privilege, and overtime a de facto part of most careers, “take on less” simply sounds like a cruel joke. The truth is that work/life balance is not an issue of individual time management, but one of social policy, as Labour’s recent commitment to a four-day working week recognises. Appreciating the broken link between rising productivity and expanded free time, John McDonnell told the Labour Party Conference that “We should work to live, not live to work”, in a speech that committed the party to cutting the working week to four days, with no associated loss in pay.
OCT4	A revolution is brewing in Egypt – and this time it will spread far beyond Tahrir Square	It all started on Friday 20 September. Tens of hundreds of people took to the streets across Egypt calling for the removal of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.  Not a big deal for a population of 100 million – but still quite an event that surprised many; especially in a country where public demonstrations have not been held since 2016.
OCT4	Kamala Harris should realize that banning Trump from Twitter wouldn't punish him — it would punish the American people	Candidates in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary race are pulling all the stops to differentiate themselves from their competitors. With this broad a field, it is interesting to watch how each candidate chooses to separate themselves from the pack: Elizabeth Warren with her four-hour selfie lines, Andrew Yang with his pledge to hand out $1,000 to each adult American, and so on.  But not all of these publicity stunts are home runs. Today, Sen. Kamala Harris penned a letter—on a campaign letterhead, no less—to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, asking him to boot President Donald Trump off of Dorsey’s platform. 
OCT4	Rivers of Thirst: Kenya’s key water sources start to dry up	By Dan Kaburu for K24 TV in Kenya Mount Kenya, in the centre of the East African country, is what locals call a ‘water tower’. Dozens of rivers rise on its steep, high slopes and flow out in all directions.
OCT4	Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is not what anyone voted for. The public must have the final say	Boris Johnson’s proposed Brexit deal has been cleverly presented as a reasonable compromise. But in reality, it represents a radical break not just from Theresa May’s proposals, but from the last 50 years of British economic and social policy. That’s why it must be put back to the people for a confirmatory referendum. That is the only fair and democratic way forward. Some still say that since the choice on the ballot paper was between “leave” and “remain”, any deal that means leave is enough. They ignore that in 2016, the leave campaign made a clear offer to the electorate and secured its victory on that basis. If this latest deal’s backers want to avoid being at the heart of a false advertising scandal, they will have to ask the customers – the people – if they still want to buy the product now they’ve seen it.
OCT4	Brussels insiders tell me they’re about to reject Boris Johnson’s new Brexit deal – and this is why	First, the good news for Boris Johnson.

OCT5	Impressive dramatic performances aside, Joker makes a mockery of mental illness	At its core, when you set aside the A-grade acting, cinematography, and the look of the thing, Joker relies on a tired and destructive trope: child abuse leads to mental illness that is murderous in character. This has become a sort of short hand for villainy. It’s used in a similar manner to physical scarring. 
OCT5	As a teenage climate activist of colour, I'm tired of being ignored by the world	On Friday 20 September, 350,000 people – myself included – took to the streets to protest the government’s inaction on the climate crisis in the UK, joined by millions more as part of the global climate strike. A week later, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets again in Montreal. But the aftermath of the demonstrations revealed an ugly side of the movement: indigenous demonstrators were subjected to racial discrimination, including verbal and physical abuse. Clearly, the climate action movement is not immune to whitewashing. Such oppression should be at odds with the targets we're working towards. But as an activist who has encountered political and social opinions from across the spectrum, it's apparent that the absence of true climate justice is often missing in people’s perceptions of a solution to the climate crisis.
OCT5	The Iraqi people are in revolt – pushing the post-Saddam Hussein settlement to the brink of collapse	Iraq is poised at a turning point in its modern history as its people wait to see if the government curfew and close down of the internet will end the ongoing demonstrations. I am staying in the Baghdad Hotel, off Sadoon Street in central Baghdad, not far from Tahrir Square, the focus of most protest movements in Iraq. On Tuesday I was expecting to visit Iraqi army bases north of Baghdad to find out if Isis was still a threat and what the chances were of it making a comeback.
OCT5	The Top 10: Marxist-Leninists Who Went On To Other Things	This list was proposed by Andy McSmith and was quickly overrun by People’s Front of Judea types. The hyphenated form is sometimes used by Stalinists to distinguish themselves from other kinds of Marxists such as Trotskyists. Some purists, though, insist that it should refer only to Maoist (or Albanian) factions. My ruling is that the more obscure the sect, and the more surprising the later career, the better. 1. Nikolai Podvoisky. In charge of military operations on the night the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917. In the 1930s, he was the leading Marxist-Leninist advocate of nudity. He said: “We can – and must – discard all ballast that separates our body from the sun: coats, jackets, vests, shirts, women’s fashions, socks and boots. Nine times out of 10, people wear them not because they need them but because they want to show off.” Opening nomination from Andy McSmith. 
OCT5	A court ruling on consent has deemed a man's sex drive more important than the horrific consequences of rape	Do women – in particular vulnerable women – have the right not to be raped? The answer, according to a judge in a recent case, seems to be “not necessarily”.  The right to sex, versus the right to safely decline sex has always been a seemingly thorny path for many of our lawmakers. The latest case, overseen by Mrs Justice Roberts, has found that an autistic man with impaired cognition, “JB”, has a fundamental right to sex – even if it involves a woman who is similarly disadvantaged and therefore unable to grant (or withdraw) consent. 
OCT5	This after-sex cleanup product reveals just how ridiculous our hygiene hangups have become	The politics of “femtech” is a tricky area. In theory, it’s a way to improve women’s lives and to address problems that have been ignored because of institutionalised sexism. In reality, it’s more often than not a way for companies to get things spectacularly wrong. A case in point: come&gone, a new product from a US company. The invention is a sponge on a stick that you pop up your vagina after sex so that it can magic away your partner’s semen. Describing the product, come&gone write on their website: “He finished, and you… need to go to the bathroom and clean up. Come&gone can help you with that. Say goodbye to your old towel, T-shirt and half a roll of toilet paper – forever.”
OCT5	As a doctor, the Tories’ abuse of the NHS in the name of xenophobia makes me sick	We’ve witnessed a slew of pronouncements from the Conservative Party in the last week. Most of which served to demonstrate a simple unyielding truth: contrary to Boris Johnson’s bemusing claim that they are the “party of the NHS”, the party clearly doesn’t understand how and why the NHS survives and continues to be the jewel in the crown of British achievement.  From the flagship pledge of building 40 new hospitals (in reality, six hospitals) to the inflammatory rhetoric of Priti Patel’s gleeful anti-immigrant antipathy, the evidence demonstrates a pernicious misunderstanding of some of the basic truths about the NHS:
OCT5	There's nothing more satisfying than watching Donald Trump and Boris Johnson be taken down by older women	There is a certain delicious irony to the fact that the guy who traded in wives as if they were auto leases is having his impeachment being led by a 79-year-old pantsuit-wearing feminist — and the man who misled the Queen into letting him suspend Parliament is being censured by a 74-year-old brooch-wearer from the wrong side of the tracks.Yes, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump find themselves stymied by older women. It seems almost too perfect, like a deeply cinematic twist — autocrats on both sides of the Atlantic being stopped by a historically marginalized group, female septuagenarians.  In America, our president’s impeachment is being led by a woman almost 10 years older than the president’s first wife (for those playing at home, that was two wives ago), the one he traded in during the early 90s. Trump may have hated Hillary Clinton but he should be very afraid of Nancy Pelosi. Nancy isn’t afraid of barbs; she once said of Trump’s obsession with his beloved border wall: “It’s like a manhood thing for him — as if manhood could ever be associated with him.” 
OCT5	The Politician proves you can mock 'wokeness' without being a baby boomer who left their empathy in the 1980s	Warning: the following piece contains mild spoilers for the first season of The Politician, but if you’ve read a few stories about the series already, then there should be nothing too surprising here If a presidential candidate is to have any credibility at all, then that candidate needs a solid running mate. This is the maxim Payton Hobart, the protagonist in Ryan Murphy’s The Politician, appears to live by. Payton, you see, might be just a high school student, but he’s known for a while that his life will only make sense if he manages to shape it like a highway to the highest office in the land.
OCT5	So the government is finally revealing its Brexit plans – and they are even sillier than we thought they’d be	In the end, sorting out the backstop was easy. All it took to get round the problem of a hard border in Ireland was to have two hard borders instead. But these will be simple, as they’ll be at unspecified places, so maybe they can change every week so everyone gets a go at being a border which is fairer. So one might be in Cork, and the other in a branch of Nandos in Eastbourne, where you can get half-price Peri-Peri chicken while you’re having your lorry investigated by customs officers. Or it could be in Qatar, as they seem to host most things they’re clearly not equipped for.
OCT6	President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is getting away with tyranny in Egypt thanks to his UK and US allies	Some parents in Egypt started banning their children from leaving the house on Fridays, fearing even if they don’t join anti-government rallies, they could be at risk of arrest. Others have confiscated their phones and forced them to delete their social media accounts. But even these precautions have not saved several from being snatched up in the largest sweep of arrests in the country since president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took office in 2014.   
OCT6	What would a government of national unity actually look like? I have an idea	Kenneth Clarke could be the prime minister who asks the EU for a Brexit extension. If Boris Johnson means what he says, he is not going to reach agreement with the EU on the terms of our exit, because he insists on a customs border in Ireland, which it says is unacceptable; and, he says, there will be “no delay”.  That was what he said after he had submitted a document to the Scottish courts confirming that he would obey the law and request an extension if there is no deal. The document says: “The prime minister accepts ... that [if parliament has not approved a withdrawal agreement] ... he will send a letter in the form set out in the schedule by no later than 19 October 2019.” 
OCT6	The Iraqi people are in revolt – pushing the post-Saddam Hussein settlement to the brink of collapse	Iraq is poised at a turning point in its modern history as its people wait to see if the government curfew and close down of the internet will end the ongoing demonstrations.

OCT6	Kamala Harris should realize that banning Trump from Twitter wouldn't punish him — it would punish the American people	Candidates in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary race are pulling all the stops to differentiate themselves from their competitors. With this broad a field, it is interesting to watch how each candidate chooses to separate themselves from the pack: Elizabeth Warren with her four-hour selfie lines, Andrew Yang with his pledge to hand out $1,000 to each adult American, and so on.  But not all of these publicity stunts are home runs. Today, Sen. Kamala Harris penned a letter—on a campaign letterhead, no less—to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, asking him to boot President Donald Trump off of Dorsey’s platform. 
OCT6	Bernie Sanders' heart condition can teach us two lessons — one about healthcare and another about Congress	After the upsetting news that he had been rushed to hospital following chest discomfort earlier today, it was found that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had a blocked artery. Emergency surgery has left the Senator for Vermont on the road to recovery — and one thing he will not have to worry about is his medical bill. Given his position in government and income, he can cover the medical costs he is served. However, this incident should serve us as an important reminder of the desperate need for healthcare reform in the US, as well as the inspiring role Sanders himself has in calling for Medicare for all. Sanders and his colleagues in government, unlike the average American citizen, do not need to worry about health insurance coverage. Those in the Congress and the Senate benefit from federal subsidies amounting to three-quarter premiums under gold-level Obamacare policies, and need only to pay for between 25 and 28 per cent of the premium. Such unfairness was identified by Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez in the past, who noted that as a waitress she would have had to pay double what she now pays as a member of Congress. It is ironic that Congress has the power to “deny people affordability that they themselves enjoy,” Ocasia-Cortez tweeted.

This has become a sort of short hand for villainy. It’s used in a similar manner to physical scarring. 
OCT6	The #MeTooPay campaign is great – but women alone can’t solve the scourge of pay inequality	Money: it’s a thorny subject; a sticky wicket. Put simply, it’s not “the done thing” to discuss in polite company. In the UK and Ireland, huge dichotomies exist when it comes to talking about money. We are all seemingly obsessed with house prices, the slightest increase in the monthly cost of Netflix but God forbid ever discussing how much you earn. This behavioural oddity is one that has been benefiting employers – unwittingly or not – for decades. But then gender pay gap reporting was introduced and all our problems were solved! Hurrah! Not so, of course, not at all so. 
OCT6	A Brexit-supporting mayor isn't what Remainer London needs – Rory Stewart would know that if he'd been paying attention	 
OCT6	As a doctor, the Tories’ abuse of the NHS in the name of xenophobia makes me sick	We’ve witnessed a slew of pronouncements from the Conservative Party in the last week.

OCT7	We are all Jennifer Arcuri. Soon we will atone for the tragic human error of going anywhere near Boris Johnson	If there turns out to have been impropriety at the heart of the Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri story, it should be made absolutely clear that it will be his – not her’s. The questions Ms Arcuri spent a full hour answering on live television on Monday morning are really questions for the prime minister, not for her. But he will not answer them, so she must.
OCT7	Trump leaves his Kurdish allies utterly betrayed by a shady deal with a desperate Erdogan	It is no secret that Turkey has been planning a large scale military operation to create a “safe zone” in northern Syria for a long time. However, it now seems to have received the necessary green light from President Trump.  This decision will have a number of serious ramifications on the power balances and security environment in the region, but there is one party that will feel disillusioned and deeply betrayed. The Kurds.
OCT7	This Yom Kippur, I'll light a candle for my father and remember we forgave each other before it was too late	My father was first to argue with my Facebook post advising my classes to "Lead the least secretive life you can." He countered: "Exactly wrong. Repression's the greatest gift of the human intellect."  Friends left laughing emojis after my 80-year-old dad's social media snark, but I was crushed. I thought I was immune to his habit of trash-talking my politics, my profession, my personality — even the city I lived in, his birthplace of Manhattan. “It’s a dirty, scummy terrible place,” he’d told my answering machine when I moved East after college. "You gonna sell your poems on the sidewalk?” 
OCT7	Online ‘psychic mediums’ are gaining popularity – but are they exploiting people’s grief?	You can get lost in pretty much any topic on social media. Icons, pictures or tantalising comments can be enough to pique our interest on subjects that aren’t usually on our radar. With so many forums and websites dedicated to certain niches, it’s not surprising that this is where the intriguing community of mediums and spiritualists has become a dominant presence. So-called mediums and their platforms are typically shared via public groups. Viewers are encouraged to do so by said spiritualists, who often sway them with the promise that one of them could be in with a chance of winning a live-streamed reading. 
OCT7	A court ruling on consent has deemed a man's sex drive more important than the horrific consequences of rape	Do women – in particular vulnerable women – have the right not to be raped?

On Tuesday I was expecting to visit Iraqi army bases north of Baghdad to find out if Isis was still a threat and what the chances were of it making a comeback.
OCT7	The threat of mass violence over Brexit is a lie designed to frighten us – it simply won't happen	In a packed tent at the Festival of Ideas at Kenwood, a member of the alarmed audience recently put to me a chilling question: how far does the language of political violence result in actual violence? Tellingly, he asked me this even before the Supreme Court judgement on Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of parliament, before the prime minister started outrageously bringing the memory of Jo Cox into a twisted defence of his own positions, and before he started dismissing the abuse and death threats directed at some women MPs. 
OCT7	Extinction Rebellion would get a hell of a lot further if they infiltrated the Tory Party	The trouble with Extinction Rebellion is that they are confusing protest and persuasion. The protest bit is going well. Sort of. Accidentally dumping a tsunami of beetroot juice on the street instead of on the Treasury was like a bungled team challenge off The Apprentice than some chilling scene from a Saw movie. But mucking up central London and driving it into gridlock for a couple of weeks will get plenty of publicity, and raise the profile. Except when someone pegs it because the emergency ambulance taking them to St Thomas hospital or Guys got stuck behind a giant pink inflatable whale or some other political dirigible. Cause of Death: Massive coronary event during wait for floating Trump baby blimp to move. Extinction Rebellion indeed. The grieving relatives will never vote Green again.  Which brings me winning the argument: persuasion. Everyone agrees, well almost, about climate change. We know we’re killing the planet, and quite quickly. There is no need to close down Heathrow with a rogue drone to highlight the facts about aviation because we know them already. What’s more, Boris Johnson is not going to lie down in front of the bulldozers just because of some albeit extensive publicity stunts. The protests only ever affect – and alienate – a tiny minority of the voters. The rest of the populace just look on and wonder why the protesters aren’t at work.
OCT7	Rory Stewart has made Pret a Manger the front line of a political class war	Rory Stewart was the talk of London town over the weekend. First for his resignation from the Conservative Party to run for Mayor of our capital city, then for declaring his favourite pub was not a pub but the butty shop, Pret a Manger. The internet responded as it traditionally does, with disdain, then mockery and then by ardently pointing out how little it actually matters. The idea is indeed funny that this odd guy is trying to win over the votes of the common people while they avoid eye contact and eat their chicken Caesar with smashed avocado. But we are wrong about it not mattering.
OCT7	What would a government of national unity actually look like? I have an idea	Kenneth Clarke could be the prime minister who asks the EU for a Brexit extension.

OCT8	Scandal-ridden Elizabeth Warren has really gone and done it now with her story about pregnancy in the workplace	When word hits that a new attempt to thwart the meteoric rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren is underway, I now think: Good God, man, what next? Is she being accused of adopting too many special-needs shelter animals? Did she hide the truth that the discovery of a breakthrough cancer treatment can, in fact, be attributed to her? What decadence! What lies! What depravity can we expect next from this, one of America’s most earnest and wholesome politicians? To paraphrase a tweet by Elle magazine staff writer R. Eric Thomas, when I look back at my life laid out on a sandy beach of time and I see the places where there is only one set of footprints, I will know it was Elizabeth Warren’s hilariously backfiring fake scandals that carried me.
OCT8	This was always a Blackadder Goes Forth Brexit – and now we prepare to go over the top	It has been the grandest situation comedy of them all. Its hilarious moments too many to condense to a single highlights reel. Strong and stable. Nothing has changed. Chris Grayling’s ferry-less ferry companies. Chris Grayling’s fake traffic jams. The collapsing backdrop, the fainting policewoman and the top floor "technology lessons". Hard Brexit, soft Brexit, smooth Brexit, red, white and blue Brexit. In the end, it was a Blackadder Goes Forth Brexit, and now we move towards the ending. We are in the trenches. The whistle is blowing. The laughing stops.
OCT8	Trump is still trying to block us from seeing his tax returns. As Scaramucci told me, that's a constitutional problem	Why would the Department of Justice want to block a New York City prosecutor from using a subpoena? The answer? Because the company is owned by the President of the United States. 
OCT8	The China juggernaut is taking over world sport, and the NBA won’t be the last to cave in	After months of turmoil in Hong Kong, mounting violence in the territory set against the backdrop of an increasingly bellicose China recently prompted the Houston Rockets basketball franchise’s general manager, Daryl Morey, to tweet: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” What Morey presumably viewed as his democratic right to freely express an opinion sparked a furious row, which has now escalated to such an extent that it could well become a full-scale diplomatic incident.
OCT8	The UK’s immigration system is ideologically broken	As the inquest into the death of another of the Windrush scandal migrants took place, I can’t help but think about the scale of the issue at hand.  Dexter Bristol was a 58-year-old Grenadian man who came to the UK at eight years old and died after what his family called 18 months of unbearable stress imposed by the Home Office. The coroner agreed that his application to remain in the UK was a “stressor” but believed he had other stressors, including being anxious about the relationship with his mother, so ruled he died of natural causes.
OCT8	This Yom Kippur, I'll light a candle for my father and remember we forgave each other before it was too late	My father was first to argue with my Facebook post advising my classes to "Lead the least secretive life you can." He countered: "Exactly wrong. Repression's the greatest gift of the human intellect."  Friends left laughing emojis after my 80-year-old dad's social media snark, but I was crushed.

"You gonna sell your poems on the sidewalk?” 
OCT8	Ellen DeGeneres being friends with George W Bush is a problem for everyone except rich people like her	This week, a social media controversy erupted when footage of prominent comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W Bush emerged, which showed the unlikely pair laughing together in the owner’s box of a Dallas Cowboys vs. Green Bay Packers game.   Amid protests and disbelief, DeGeneres appeared on The Ellen Show today, saying: “ I’m friends with George Bush. In fact, I’m friends with a lot of people who don’t share the same beliefs I have… And I think we’ve forgotten that that’s OK, that’s we’re all different.” 
OCT8	Britain must help Hong Kong's protesters in their fight against a police state	A few days ago, Hong Kongers “celebrated” the Chinese national day with large-scale protests and confrontations with the police. One of our comrades, an 18-year-old student, was shot by a policeman, which further fuelled popular discontent with the government. In the meantime, countless protesters were arrested, tortured and interrogated. And now, the authorities have apparently gone even further.
OCT8	Extinction Rebellion would get a hell of a lot further if they infiltrated the Tory Party	The trouble with Extinction Rebellion is that they are confusing protest and persuasion. The protest bit is going well. Sort of.

OCT8	For doctors like me, joining Extinction Rebellion is a moral duty	As a doctor, I’m bound by good clinical practice to hold human life with the utmost respect, to practice from a scientific evidence base, and to act promptly when patient safety may be compromised. And I’m supporting Extinction Rebellion – not as a “nose-ringed crusty”, but out of duty to this ethical code, and out of respect to the evidence that the climate crisis is, as the Lancet called it, “the greatest threat to human health of the 21st century”. I work as a GP in Tower Hamlets, a borough in east London with some of the highest rates of air pollution. Children in my community have a lung capacity on average 10 per cent lower than their peers.
OCT9	Scandal-ridden Elizabeth Warren has really gone and done it now with her story about pregnancy in the workplace	When word hits that a new attempt to thwart the meteoric rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren is underway, I now think: Good God, man, what next? Is she being accused of adopting too many special-needs shelter animals?

OCT9	No wonder Brexiteers tried to disown the Merkel 'Kraut' meme. It revealed their twisted worldview for all to see	“We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,” read the “witty” Leave.EU meme. No wit at all, of course, but you could see what they were trying to do: the same thing they try to do in all their memes, which is amateur journalism. Trying to recreate the sort of inventive puns and cheeky defiance you’d see on the front page of The Sun, they just ended up being offensive and not really making much of a point. We can only thank providence that the Leave.EU meme design workshop didn’t see fit to add a Hitler ‘tache and a Nazi armband to Angela Merkel’s features, or stick her on top of a Panzer, adding in some utterly horrific reference to the Holocaust for good measure. Because that’s what the Leave.EU lot are like – boneheads, with no experience of war or bloodshed.
OCT9	Mitt Romney isn't acting out of principle — but he could still be the hero in the room	If you told me even a month ago that the fate of the republic may rest with Mitt Romney, my response likely would have been to say it’s time for me to go back to watching The Handmaid’s Tale in order to prepare for America turning into a real-life Gilead in the not too distant future.  However, to the credit of the former Massachusetts governor, presidential candidate, and current junior senator of Utah, he has shown signs recently that he has a spine — or, if nothing else, a keen sense of when the tide is turning. 
OCT9	Sleazy pick-up artists are thriving – and they’re exploiting men’s insecurities over #MeToo to do it	Has #MeToo helped stamp out sexism? It has certainly exposed the sexism women have faced – and been saying we’ve been facing – for aeons. But what of the sexist men behind the assaults and the degradation – are their minds changing? This week’s Panorama saw journalist Myles Bonnar go undercover and join one of the UK’s “seduction boot camps” – weekends during which men desperate for sex set themselves back as much as £1,500 to learn how to persuade women to go to bed with them, making the “cold approach” on the street and securing “same-day lays”.
OCT9	Trump is still trying to block us from seeing his tax returns. As Scaramucci told me, that's a constitutional problem	Why would the Department of Justice want to block a New York City prosecutor from using a subpoena? The answer?

OCT9	Kurdish soldiers I spoke to feared Trump would be a treacherous ally. But the scale of his betrayal is terrifying	In a field beside a disused railway station on the plain just south of the Syrian-Turkish frontier, a brigade of Syrian Kurdish soldiers were retraining in order to resist an invasion by the Turkish army. “We acted like a regular army when we were fighting Daesh [Isis],” Rojvan, a veteran Kurdish commander of the YPG (People’s Protection Units), told me. “But now it is we who may be under Turkish air attack and we will have to behave more like guerrillas.” Rojvan and his men had just returned from fighting Isis for 45 days in their last strongholds in eastern Syria. I had met him first in a cemetery in the Kurdish capital Qamishli where he was burying one of his men who had been killed by an Isis rocket when driving a bulldozer to build field fortifications in the middle of a battle.
OCT9	Disabled people like me are fair game for hate crime, and our government must shoulder some of the blame	Worried about the stress levels of the bigot in your life? Concerned he’s getting all stirred up and might have to do without his blood pressure pills after a no-deal Brexit?  Fear not, because today is kick a cripple day! 
OCT9	After Trump’s go-ahead for Turkey to invade Syria, the Kurdish population is in for even more upheaval	There is a road in northeast Syria that runs alongside the border with Turkey, so close in parts that the imposing wall which separates the two countries casts a shadow over it.  It stretches for more than 200 miles through Turkey’s proposed “safe zone”. To travel along it is to experience the complexities of an area that may soon become a new frontline in Syria’s war. 
OCT9	Excluding women of colour from breast cancer awareness campaigns isn’t just irresponsible – it’s deadly	Pink boobs. Giant inflatable pink boobs. This is the image that popped up on my Twitter feed a few days ago. The boob bus is a campaign launched by Lorraine Kelly for the Change and Check breast cancer awareness campaign to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness month this October. My boobs don’t look like this, is what came to my mind. It might be too much information, but that really is the first thing that popped up in my head, not that I need to check my breasts for signs of cancer.  I could not take this message seriously while I was faced with this undeniably white version of human mammary glands. They also do not look anatomically accurate, but perhaps the designers could be forgiven for this. After all, they aren’t meant to be entirely realistic and there are practical considerations to take into account. However, the colour of these “model breasts” and the imagery that is being used in this campaign is far from inclusive. There is already a huge bias in breast cancer screenings. Non-white women are less likely to be diagnosed at an early stage. Research has shown that black women are 45 per cent more likely to die of breast cancer compared with white women, even though the rate of occurrence is similar. 
OCT10	The Conservative ‘nasty party’ are officially back with a vengeance – and I’ve just been attacked by them	Conservative Party members are going to extreme lengths to defend their leader against allegations of sexual impropriety.  
OCT10	Of course Extinction Rebellion is unpopular, they’re forcing us to sacrifice our selfishness just because the world is in danger	The lesson from these Extinction Rebellion protesters, that all sensible people have drawn, is they might be trying to warn us we’re killing off every living thing on the planet, but I COULDN’T GET TO DEBENHAMS, THE BASTARDS, so I appreciate their message about all of us dying but I WAS TRYING TO ORDER A SET OF CURTAINS so they should KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE, THE TW**S. It’s a measure of our dedication to getting on with the day, that Suffolk could be a desert, with people living off scorpions and cactus juice, and many of us would scream “OH NO these bloody Extinction Rebellion idiots are in my way AGAIN, now I CAN’T GET MY CAMEL PAST THEM.”
OCT10	I couldn’t heal from baby loss until I had space to talk about it – I want the same for other women too	A common pattern emerges when I try to have conversations with most friends or colleagues about baby loss – we just don’t like to talk about it. While we have progressed so much as a society in terms of our openness about mental health or cancer diagnosis, the loss of a child or pregnancy still makes people feel uncomfortable.   How and when we want to share our losses, if at all, should, of course, always be a personal choice. However, the culture of secrecy and silence surrounding baby loss, in part, contributes to the UK having one of the worst stillbirth rates in the developed world. Sadly, the majority of women who have experienced multiple miscarriages (of which I’m one) never find out the reason why. If only we talked about it more, not only could we accelerate our understanding of those preventable cases of stillbirth (estimated to be around 50 per cent) but also alleviate some of the unnecessary pain and isolation that baby loss brings into people’s lives.
OCT10	Banning eating on the train is not only a silly idea, it also offers dangerous ammunition to right-wing trolls	The lack of political nous demonstrated by some eminent and highly intelligent public figures never ceases to amaze.  Take Dame Sally Davies, the government’s outgoing chief medical officer. 
OCT10	Why we need to stop using the word ‘homeless’	 Imagine a world in which your identity rested solely on the type of home you lived in. A world in which people were defined as bedsitters, flat-sharers or one-up-one-downers, instead of a combination of complex intertwining factors like race, political beliefs, age, gender or sexuality. This is a ridiculous idea that ignores the intricate reality of human existence, disregarding the never-ending process of identification to portray people as a reflection of what they own.
OCT10	Mitt Romney isn't acting out of principle — but he could still be the hero in the room	If you told me even a month ago that the fate of the republic may rest with Mitt Romney, my response likely would have been to say it’s time for me to go back to watching The Handmaid’s Tale in order to prepare for America turning into a real-life Gilead in the not too distant future.  However, to the credit of the former Massachusetts governor, presidential candidate, and current junior senator of Utah, he has shown signs recently that he has a spine — or, if nothing else, a keen sense of when the tide is turning. 
OCT10	It might not be nice and it might not be fair but for the good of the country, Joe Biden has to go	The Democrats must defeat Trump. This is not just a political objective; it is an existential necessity. Four more years of Trump is almost beyond comprehension. Everything must yield to that imperative. And so Joe Biden must go. No, it is not fair — it is just necessary. The justification for Joe Biden’s candidacy was that he could beat Trump. He could win in the Rust Belt. He is a safe pair of hands, a return to normalcy after the exhausting chaos of every day with President Trump. For that objective, we could put aside the Anita Hill hearings, the Iraq War vote, the dog-whistles on busing, the profile in something less than courage. He could turn out African American voters, more even than African American candidates. And he could bring working class whites, the Reagan Democrats who put Trump in the White House, back to the Democratic column, meaning that Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, maybe even Ohio might return to the fold.
OCT10	I was counting my sins in a synagogue during the Halle attack. It feels like I was at the scene of the crime	I’m not religious, but I still went to synagogue yesterday for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. This I did for two reasons: to keep my dad company (my father who art in Streatham, not my father who art in heaven) and because I like the festival’s self-improvement vibe – spending one day a year thinking about the bad things you’ve done and trying to do better. I was counting my sins while studiously not checking my phone when the rabbi stopped his sermon to softly mention there had just been a deadly shooting at a synagogue in the German city of Halle.
OCT10	Erdogan's assault in Syria will draw in regional powers, and risks handing Turkey its own Yemen-style quagmire	Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has wasted no time with the green light granted by his opposite number in Washington. He has ordered his military into north-east Syria in the first stage of what many fear will be a bid to ethnically cleanse an area of 30-40km deep into Syria of its Kurdish local inhabitants. France, Britain, Germany, and most Arab countries, lashed out at Erdogan. US Senator Lindsay Graham said he is leading a bipartisan effort to impose “severe sanctions against Turkey for their invasion.”
OCT10	There will be no soft Brexit. It doesn't exist, and we shouldn’t have kidded ourselves that it ever did	One of the biggest and most pernicious myths in British history, perpetuated before, during and long after the 2016 EU referendum is that there is such a thing as a “soft Brexit”. This is the shimmering mirage of the “deal”, this historic compromise that, we’re told, is only prevented by the stupidity, obduracy and dishonesty of our MPs, or the EU. Well it is plain wrong, as was long predictable and is perfectly apparent today. Like other things in life – pregnancy, say – Europe is a binary matter.
OCT11	I campaigned for Brexit for nearly 30 years, but this destructive government has made me a Remainer (for now)	I recently and publicly disassociated myself from Brexit after nearly 30 years of campaigning for it. I did not do this lightly or because I am suddenly converted to a new EU-centric vision of the UK’s future. In fact, I still maintain that Brexit is the better path for both the UK and the EU.  However, this WTO-only Brexit this government seems wedded to is a greater threat than membership of the EU on current terms could ever be.
OCT11	Trump wants you to believe he's withdrawing from Syria because he hates America's 'endless wars'. The truth is very different	The sudden withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, immediately followed by Turkish military advances, has shocked many and left Donald Trump facing his latest wave of criticism. Explaining his decision, the president yesterday tweeted, “I am trying to end the ENDLESS wars.” Trump’s track record, however, suggests something different: that he is a man infatuated with military strength and power. 
OCT11	The Top 10: Parliament buildings	Thanks to Allan Faulds, who compiled a heroic Twitter thread of the buildings housing the lower house of parliament of all 193 countries of the world, which is well worth reading in full and very funny. Here, in no particular order, are my 10 favourites.  1. Hungary (above). As Allan says, “This is it. This is the parliament. A legislative building without compare.” Gothic. Tick. Dome. Tick. Red. Tick. He also says it is “unutterably gorgeous inside too”, and I’ll take his word for it.

OCT11	We have to talk about mental health – but saying ‘get help’ means nothing when the system is failing you	Yesterday was World Mental Health Day, and while my social media feeds were clogged with heartfelt posts detailing people’s tricky experiences, one message really irked me: “help is out there”. Is it? Maybe with your stable income and option of private health that’s true, but for me, a student reliant on an oversubscribed NHS and understaffed university counselling service, it’s not. It’s out there, but it’s six months away.

OCT12	Johnson securing a Brexit deal would be a disaster for Swinson – but Corbyn might secretly be pleased	If Boris Johnson succeeds in taking Britain out of the EU, Jeremy Corbyn will be pleased. The Labour leader has to pretend he wants an election now, but he must dread the prospect. He does not really want Brexit to be postponed and to have to fight an election campaign explaining that he has no view on whether we should leave or remain. “Get Brexit done” would be a strong message for the Tories, especially if the Labour counter-offer is “whatevs”.

OCT12	As you cheer the Iranian women supporting their football team, remember one of us died before Fifa would listen	This week, thousands of Iranian women lawfully attended a football game for the first time since 1981. The gates of the stadium where the national team was playing Cambodia were crowded with women wearing red white and green jester hats; since the patriotic headgear clearly covered all of their hair, the authorities could not argue that the women were flouting the Islamic Republic’s “modesty” rule. Women in Iran have been protesting against the enforced hijab law for some time now by taking them off in public spaces and waving them on sticks. A powerful image, yes, but not as fun as a sea of caps with bells on. Far from looking ridiculous, the women carried off the novelty hats with the innate elegance and poise typical of my Iranian sisters. (This is a trait I sadly did not inherit; instead I got the regressive “bufoonish, spits food out when she talks’’ gene, leaving me to admire and envy my Persian sisters.)

OCT12	It’s impossible to ‘succeed’ in the Brexit talks – this is one of the stupidest things a country has ever done	There appears to be a slight sense of jubilation emerging, even among sensible people, that the very worst of Brexits might be avoided. Ireland and the EU, though not the UK, just yet, are intimating that a Brexit deal could be done. What that would mean for British people is that the very worst impacts of Brexit – the ones that involve food shortages, fuel shortages, medicine shortages and widespread civil unrest (and this is the government’s own analysis) – would not come to pass.
OCT12	As Turkey prepares to slice through Syria, the US has cleared a new breeding ground for Isis	“Never get into a well with an American rope” goes the saying spreading across the Middle East, as the US abandons its Kurdish allies in Syria to a Turkish invasion force. People in the region are traditionally cynical about the loyalty of great powers to their local friends, but even they are shocked by the speed and ruthlessness with which Donald Trump greenlit the Turkish attack.  According to the UN and human rights groups, tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees are in flight from their border towns and are being targeted by Turkish airstrikes and artillery fire. Most leaders contemplating ethnic cleansing keep quiet about it, but Turkey’s President Erdogan is openly declaring that he will settle two million Syrian Arab refugees from other parts of Syria on Kurdish lands (he says he’s discovered that the land is not really Kurdish).

OCT13	Remainers are poised to fend off no deal, but what will they do if Boris Johnson secures one?	What if there is a Brexit deal?  What if, despite the initial mood music to the contrary from the EU and the Johnson government, they came to an agreement? Perhaps not at the 17-18 October summit but at a later date? The story of whether a deal is possible ebbs and flows wildly. And because the Brexit process is being conducted like a daily soap opera, the broad outlines of the plot are in danger of being lost sight of. Bloodcurdling warnings of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, or threats by Dominic Cummings, have rather obscured the prosaic reality that “no deal” is still unlikely to happen and that most of us are conducting our lives on the assumption that it won’t. The fact remains that for now “no deal” would be unlawful unless the Commons consents, and it won’t.
OCT13	I don’t want another woman to face sexual harassment in Westminster like I did – the time to end abuse is now	The #MeToo movement amplified women’s voices across the globe, including mine. It was that campaign that finally gave me the courage to come forward after 12 years of silence, to report that I was a victim of sexual harassment. I am widely considered an empowered woman who, for over two decades, has stood up for women that do not have a voice. And yet when it came to reporting my own sexual harassment, I had previously felt paralysed.
OCT13	Closing Tottenham's ‘Latin Village’ market is essentially social cleansing - it must be stopped	Pueblito Paisa, also known as ‘Latin Village’, is located in the heart of North London in Seven Sisters, Tottenham, and for decades has provided a thriving market place for working class ethnic minority immigrant communities and businesses. It hosts the second-largest Latino community in the UK. The landmark Seven Sisters Indoor Market attracts visitors from not just London, but also from across the country. Since its inception in the early 2000s it has offered a safe haven for those fleeing persecution in their home countries, allowing them to set up businesses and become part of a thriving community hub. For new arrivals looking to make a new life amid the hustle and bustle of an often unforgiving city, Pueblito Paisa offers a slice of home, while providing a little comfort and support.
OCT13	This learning disability film festival is helping people and condescending critics should shut up and watch	“A feel-good exercise.” “A children’s festival.”
OCT13	Is it not time for serious condemnation of Boris Johnson’s behaviour?	Like many I am deeply disturbed by the damage Boris Johnson is doing to the reputation of our ministers and to our parliament and the Queen. I’m aware that the news media must be guarded in its comments, but is it not now the time to condemn in no uncertain terms the damage Johnson is doing to the hardworking good people trying to ensure good living standards for their families?

OCT13	Our black British historical icons of tomorrow are here – let’s not wait 50 years to celebrate them	These past few weeks have been incredible for black British millennial and Gen Z women. Twenty-three-year-old Dina Asher-Smith from Orpington became the first British person to win three medals at one major world athletics championships; 26 year old Katarina Johnson-Thompson from Liverpool broke the British world record in the heptathlon at the same world championship; and Don’t Hate The Playaz became the first British TV show to have an all-black female panel, with many of the panellists being in their twenties and thirties. Millennials, which, according to the Pew Research Centre, includes anyone who is any age from 23-38 this year, and Generation Z – anyone who is 22 or younger this year – are two of the most successful demographics of our time. While it’s important that we recognise the contributions of all-black British public figures, the younger generation of brilliant writers, actors and directors, is worth highlighting now. Particularly black women. As feminist scholar Angela Davis has said in the past, blackness is often “implicitly gendered as male,” often erasing these experiences. So it’s important that we recognise them now in their own right. 
OCT13	Medical cannabis could be the key to stopping a US-style opioid crisis in the UK	For much of the 20th century, the UK and much of the developed world have been engaged in an expensive and ineffective war on cannabis – a psychoactive herbal drug that is not known to have ever poisoned or killed anyone.  Meanwhile, in plain sight, the pharmaceutical industry has hooked much of Britain and North America on powerful painkillers, known as opioids, that can be highly addictive. Worse still, when they are over-consumed or mixed with alcohol or other legal drugs, they can be lethal. Tragically, this kind of pill-popping Russian roulette has left a trail of dead bodies in nearly every community where these drugs have been widely prescribed. And these unlucky victims are mostly ordinary people under the age of 40. Meanwhile, the death toll keeps mounting unabated.
OCT13	Boris Johnson's general election gambit is eerily similar to the machinations of 100 years ago	In Simon Heffer’s new 900-page history of the First World War, Staring at God, he describes the coupon election hysteria of a century ago. Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the Conservatives called the election held in December 1918 to cash in on the victory celebration fever that swept Britain after the armistice with Germany.
OCT13	Trump and Erdogan have much in common – and the Kurds will be the tragic victims of their idiocy	What perfidy. Is there any more solemn a word that can be developed in the English language for such treachery? The west’s Kurdish allies are being betrayed all over again. Like Kissinger, like Trump. And here come the Turks again, once more playing their border games, pretending they are fighting against “terrorism” when they were perfectly prepared to assist al-Nusra in Afrin while oil from Isis flowed into the country. And Trump now suddenly realises that the Turks are not good allies when he was perfectly happy to let them invade northern Syria four days ago. If anything could be more illustrative of the madhouse in Washington it has been the divisive, insane “policy” which the Americans still claim to uphold in northern Syria. A hundred thousand displaced, dozens of civilians dead. In Damascus, the Assad regime must be appreciating this farce, although the chances of taking back territory from Turkey probably looks a good deal more dangerous. But the prospect of Syria’s invaders fighting each other will evoke only bitter reflection in a state where the government had almost won its war.
OCT14	The government's Voter ID law threatens thousands of voters – all to solve a problem that doesn't exist	Picture the scenario: a city sees eight suspected burglaries take place over the course of a year. In response, the government declares that all residents must purchase new security gates – or they won’t be allowed into their own homes. This would be heavy-handed, draconian, and unfair. After all, the government should go after the wrong-doers, not innocent residents.
OCT14	The new mayor of Budapest has shown us how to defeat authoritarian populists like Viktor Orban	Budapest has a new mayor, an event which rarely troubles the international press. But this time around it has confirmed how Europe can reject the invidious influence of populist, neo-authoritarian governments with an inclusive platform that pulls opposition together. The lessons for the continent, and indeed for Brexit, are inescapable. Eastern Europe has been here before: 30 years ago the dissidence against communism also won based on similar platforms that brought together a plethora of political forces, from conservative democrats to environmentalists. They may not last, but these alliances pushed aside authoritarian governments and opened up space for a new form of politics in the long-run. 
OCT14	There is a way to help us all be ethical consumers – we’re just not using it yet	 More and more investors are trying to invest “responsibly”, taking account of issues as diverse as companies’ carbon footprint, working conditions, executive pay and transparency on tax, to name but a few. These criteria can be gathered into three broad categories: environmental, social and governance (ESG). Taken together, they provide a metric for how “well behaved” a company is across all sorts of pressing issues.
OCT14	This learning disability film festival is helping people and condescending critics should shut up and watch	“A feel-good exercise.” “A children’s festival.”
OCT14	Is it not time for serious condemnation of Boris Johnson’s behaviour?	Like many I am deeply disturbed by the damage Boris Johnson is doing to the reputation of our ministers and to our parliament and the Queen. I’m aware that the news media must be guarded in its comments, but is it not now the time to condemn in no uncertain terms the damage Johnson is doing to the hardworking good people trying to ensure good living standards for their families?
OCT14	We have to talk about mental health – but saying ‘get help’ means nothing when the system is failing you	Yesterday was World Mental Health Day, and while my social media feeds were clogged with heartfelt posts detailing people’s tricky experiences, one message really irked me: “help is out there”. Is it? Maybe with your stable income and option of private health that’s true, but for me, a student reliant on an oversubscribed NHS and understaffed university counselling service, it’s not. It’s out there, but it’s six months away. 
OCT14	This was a surreal Queen’s Speech, pretending Brexit is in the bag just to kick off a Tory election campaign	The Queen’s Speech is normally an occasion for the government to go on the offensive and dominate the news agenda. Sure enough, today’s list of 26 bills looks meaty enough at first glance, and there was no shortage of confidence in the prime minister’s message. Only Boris Johnson could talk about releasing “the talent, creativity, innovation and chutzpah that exists in every corner of our UK”.  But the backcloth made this speech nothing short of surreal. This is politics through the looking glass. The government is more than 40 short of a majority. There is little prospect of any even mildly controversial legislation being approved by the Commons. If MPs are in the mood to make Johnson’s life difficult, they could defeat the entire speech in next week’s vote on it.
OCT14	The five clearest reasons why Boris Johnson’s so-called Brexit deal must be rejected this week	By this time next week, we should know whether the UK will leave the European Union on 31 October or whether an extension to the Article 50 process has been granted so we do not crash out without a deal in the short term. This will all depend on whether the prime minister can win agreement for his proposals, first from the EU at the European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday, and then from the UK parliament on Saturday. 
OCT14	I know the trauma faced by refugees. Now I want businesses to ease the cruelty they endure from populist leaders	The mass movement of people is a global phenomenon; one that is here to stay. A former refugee myself, as a child I experienced the trauma and wrenching displacement of fleeing my home during the Korean War. The human suffering I witnessed as I fled my burning village with my parents continued to haunt me in the days and years to come.  As secretary-general of the United Nations, I met so many children around the world, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, who reminded me of my own painful experiences. Seeing myself in each of them, I have remained determined to elevate the plight of refugees to the top of the global agenda today.

The fact remains that for now “no deal” would be unlawful unless the Commons consents, and it won’t.
OCT15	Angela Merkel is right. The UK is now the EU’s ‘competitor.’ It is not a fight the UK can hope to win	Whether the UK leaves the EU by Boris Johnson’s artificial deadline of 31 October only matters only if you are interested in the terrifying egos of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings. But the clearest sign that the exit is nearing, be it on that day or by way of some kind of technical extension, came from Angela Merkel on Sunday.
OCT15	Tuesday's debate will be all about Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Tom Steyer	It’s set to be a crowded night tomorrow evening during the fourth round of the Democratic presidential debates with 12 candidates onstage – the most this year. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard will be making an appearance again after missing the last debate and billionaire Tom Steyer will also take the stage for the first time with the other candidates.  Some analysts have predicted a breakthrough night from Gabbard, despite the fact that her performances have hardly been standout ones in the past few months. In earlier debates, she told Sen. Kamala Harris that "people suffered under her reign" as Attorney General of California. Recently, she criticized Sen. Elizabeth Warren for what she characterized as a lack of leadership ability. It’s fair to say she’s on the offensive, probably as a visibility strategy, but not every move is going down well. Most notably, her impeachment views have set her apart from the field in a bad way: she told the Hill’s show Rising that the transcript of Trump’s Ukraine call doesn’t make a “compelling” case for impeachment. It will be interesting to see how this goes down on a live debate stage. 
OCT15	We don't talk enough about the impact social media has on parents' mental health	We can all fall into the "looking good on Insta" trap. Until recently, I’ve been, like most parents I know, proud of my children, happy to share with friends and family the bright spots of our day, pictures of the happy times we have together. At its best, of course, and the reason we like it, is social media creates connections between people and captures moments and memories we all love to share. There’s a lot going for it. But the truth is this is only part of the social media story. It doesn’t show the bad days. 
OCT15	Kingsman is a terrible film with a poisonous message — of course Donald Trump is being doctored into it	We hit a new low in culture and politics this week when a doctored video of the President of the United States shooting up his opponents, modeled on a scene from the film Kingsman, was shown to Trump supporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence. The video shows Trump, whose face is doctored onto the character played by Colin Firth in the original film, killing detractors including Hillary Clinton and the Black Lives Matter movement.  The footage was presented in a side-room of a conference held at the ‘American Priority’ festival, which says on its site that it supports “the America First but not alone agenda.” It’s worth reading a primer on the fascist-friendly connotations of the “America First” slogan, which, in the hands of Hitler-supporting tycoon Randolph William Hearst in the 1930s, was used as a rallying cry to crush the left and as an antisemitic dogwhistle against “foreign financiers”. 
OCT15	The new mayor of Budapest has shown us how to defeat authoritarian populists like Viktor Orban	Budapest has a new mayor, an event which rarely troubles the international press. But this time around it has confirmed how Europe can reject the invidious influence of populist, neo-authoritarian governments with an inclusive platform that pulls opposition together. The lessons for the continent, and indeed for Brexit, are inescapable. Eastern Europe has been here before: 30 years ago the dissidence against communism also won based on similar platforms that brought together a plethora of political forces, from conservative democrats to environmentalists. They may not last, but these alliances pushed aside authoritarian governments and opened up space for a new form of politics in the long-run. 
OCT15	There is a way to help us all be ethical consumers – we’re just not using it yet	 More and more investors are trying to invest “responsibly”, taking account of issues as diverse as companies’ carbon footprint, working conditions, executive pay and transparency on tax, to name but a few. These criteria can be gathered into three broad categories: environmental, social and governance (ESG). Taken together, they provide a metric for how “well behaved” a company is across all sorts of pressing issues.
OCT15	Imprisonment in the UAE left me suicidal. But my fellow academics still face exactly the same risks	Last year I was imprisoned for nearly seven months in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). I was held predominantly in solitary confinement, endured heavy interrogations, with my human rights violated on a daily basis. During my imprisonment I was force fed drugs, battled depression and thoughts of self-harm. Later, having endured nearly half a year of isolation and mistreatment, I wrestled with thoughts of suicide.
OCT15	The north faces a stark reality with this damaging, needless Brexit. It is why we will march for a Final Say	When the cost of trains to the capital goes through the roof and hotel rooms can barely be found. When you see coaches of people cheer and salute as they pass each other on the M6 or the A1. When you hear trumpets and trombones and singing outside stations, it is normally because people from the north are attending another final. Except this weekend, Wembley will be silent. 
OCT15	As an election looms, we will have to be deadly serious about tactical voting to defeat Boris Johnson's Brexit	A general election is coming, almost certainly before the end of the year. At the time of writing, bookies are putting the odds at evens for a polling day falling in December. I happen to believe that a Final Say referendum should come before any election. It will provide clarity (in the form of a specific mandate) and closure (as a specific mandate entails a route to fulfil it, unlike the mandate from 2016) to the Brexit debate. 
OCT15	The government's Voter ID law threatens thousands of voters – all to solve a problem that doesn't exist	Picture the scenario: a city sees eight suspected burglaries take place over the course of a year. In response, the government declares that all residents must purchase new security gates – or they won’t be allowed into their own homes. This would be heavy-handed, draconian, and unfair. After all, the government should go after the wrong-doers, not innocent residents.
OCT16	When even the NAO predicts post-Brexit chaos, it's time to start worrying	The latest damning no-deal Brexit report from the National Audit Office was a treat for the media – by which I mean that part of it still committed to reporting news, as opposed to pro-Brexit propaganda. It offered a veritable smorgasbord of headline options. For the Financial Times the main issue was trade flows. They could be cut in half if it happens. The BBC went with the danger of criminals exploiting gaps in preparedness.  Always a good one that. Here at the Independent, we focused on the issue of timing: ministers have run out of it, and now there's no chance of improving a pretty dire situation.
OCT16	Black History Month should be a time for action – and white people, that includes you too	If done right, Black History Month in the UK can feel like Christmas in the truest sense: Full of joy, activities, a gathering of people you don’t always see, nostalgia and, much like my experience of Christmas, an underlying sense that something doesn’t feel quite right. That’s not to say I don’t enjoy the multitudes of events on offer during October, or the excuse to celebrate and lift up my black siblings, or even the (not without fault) black magazine covers I may get to experience more of in October (guilty as charged); I like seeing black folk in full gloss.
OCT16	French secularism is giving far-right MPs licence to target Muslim women yet again	Another year, another row over secularism and the hijab in France. This time, the debate erupted after a far-right politician asked a woman who was accompanying her son and other children on a school trip to a regional council headquarters to remove her headscarf when entering the building. It is a reminder that, for all our progress, Islamophobia is still rife – in France, and right across Europe. As a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf, it is really frustrating and obviously upsetting to face discrimination just for following the tenets of my faith. I know too well the pain of experiencing Islamophobia first hand in the UK. I have been verbally abused and harassed by members of the public just because my faith is visible to them.
OCT16	We don't talk enough about the impact social media has on parents' mental health	We can all fall into the "looking good on Insta" trap. Until recently, I’ve been, like most parents I know, proud of my children, happy to share with friends and family the bright spots of our day, pictures of the happy times we have together. At its best, of course, and the reason we like it, is social media creates connections between people and captures moments and memories we all love to share. There’s a lot going for it. But the truth is this is only part of the social media story. It doesn’t show the bad days.

OCT16	The NBA and Activision Blizzard are one thing — but Trump's silence on China is downright eerie	Be careful what you say about the pro-democracy protests roiling Hong Kong: the Chinese Communist Party is always listening. That warning may sound sensational, but for basketball fans and the 30 million players of Blizzard’s popular competitive video game Hearthstone, it isn’t far from the truth. That’s because China is engaging in an unprecedented push to leverage its massive domestic market power to silence critics abroad. 
OCT16	Failed Brexit talks on the Irish border will be bad for Britain – and an absolute catastrophe for the EU	In the political Groundhog Day that is Brexit, we have been told that "crunch time" is just around the corner on so many separate occasions that the word has lost practically all meaning. This week, though, the crunchiest crunch time yet has presented itself. Our government’s very existence is predicated on the set-in-stone Brexit date of 31 October, and the final EU Council summit before that date is a mere three days away. If a Brexit deal is not reached imminently, the prime minister will either take us out without a deal or be replaced by another who would pursue a referendum. The deal, then, is now or never.
OCT16	Boris Johnson’s rushed Brexit deal has nowhere to turn	Boris Johnson wants, and arguably needs, to return from the two-day summit of EU leaders on Friday waving a “deal in our time” piece of paper. We don’t yet know whether that might be a real deal, or an agreement in principle requiring further work on the vexed question of customs arrangements on the island of Ireland. As intensive talks on a Brexit deal resumed in Brussels today, UK officials played down hopes of an early breakthrough. One EU insider told me: “We can see the outlines of a deal, but turning it into a legal text is the hardest part.” Another said “today the mood music is more pessimistic than yesterday”, even if he pulls off a deal.
OCT16	Our research in Hong Kong reveals what people really think of the protesters – and the police	Even though the Hong Kong government has withdrawn the controversial extradition bill that roused the largest protest movement in the region’s history, the uprising it triggered has yet to die down. Far from it: throughout September and October, police-protester clashes have continued to escalate, with levels of violence intensifying on both sides. In recent weeks, the protesters’ tactics have now extended to vandalising metro stations and shops owned by mainland Chinese capital. Some have also started to embrace a tactic they call “private resolution”: the idea that given the untrustworthiness of the police, protesters should defend themselves and use proportionate violence against counter-protesters who assaulted protesters. This has been condemned in some quarters as plain and simple vigilantism.
OCT16	England should have walked off in Bulgaria. This was not a moment for half measures in the face of racism	When the idea about players walking off the pitch in the face of racial abuse was spoken about a few years ago, I was never a great fan. I, more than most, understand how abhorrent overt racist abuse at football matches can be. But the problems I envisaged were ones around the interpretation of racist behaviour, and the integrity of the game itself.
